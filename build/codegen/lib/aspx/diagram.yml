    - :name: layout.type
      :type: String
      :description: The type of the layout algorythm to use.
      :default: LayoutType.Tree
      :values:
          - tree - organizes a diagram in a hierarchical way and is typically used in organizational representations.
          - force - The force-directed layout algorithm (also known as the spring-embedder algorithm) is based on a physical simulation of forces acting on the nodes whereby the links define whether two nodes act upon each other. Each link effectively is like a spring embedded in the diagram. The simulation attempts to find a minimum energy state in such a way that the springs are in their base-state and thus do not pull or push any (linked) node.
          - layered - Layered graph layout is a type of graph layout in which the nodes of a (directed) graph are drawn in horizontal or vertical layers with the links directed in the complementary direction. It is also known as Sugiyama or hierarchical graph layout. When the graph is a tree the layout reduces to a standard tree layout and thus can be considered as an extension to the classic tree layout.

    - :name: layout.subtype
      :type: String
      :description: The subtype further defines the layout type by specifying in greater detail the behaviour expected by the layout algorithm.
      :default: LayoutSubtype.Down
      :values:
          - down - tree layout specific subtype. The tree is arranged with the root at the top and its children downwards.
          - up - tree layout specific subtype. The tree is arranged with the root at the bottom and its children upwards.
          - left - tree layout specific subtype. The tree is arranged with the root at the left and its children sideways to the right.
          - right - tree layout specific subtype. The tree is arranged with the root at the right and its children sideways to the left.
          - mindmapHorizontal - tree layout specific subtype. The root sits at the center and its children are spread equally to the left and right.
          - mindmapVertical - tree layout specific subtype. The root sits at the center and its children are spread equally above and below.
          - radial - tree layout specific subtype. The root sits at the center and its children are spread radially around.
          - tipOver - tree layout specific subtype. A special version of the tree-down layout where the grand-children (and iteratively) are arranged vertically while the direct children are arranged horizontally. This arrangement has the advantage that it doesn't spread as much as the classic tree-down layout. See below for a concrete example.
          - horizontal - layered layout specific subtype. The preferred direction of the links is horizontal.
          - vertical - layered layout specific subtype. The preferred direction of the links is vertical.
