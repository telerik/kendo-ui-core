1. Software License. 

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Telerik hereby grants to You the following limited, non–exclusive, non–transferable license (the “License”) to use the Telerik computer software identified as Kendo UI Professional and any updates, upgrades, modifications and error corrections thereto provided to You by Telerik (the “Programs”) and any accompanying documentation (the “Documentation” and, together with the Programs, the “Software”) as set forth below. You are granted either a Trial License pursuant to Section 1.1 or a Commercial License with Updates and Support pursuant to Section 1.2. Which version of the License applies (i.e., Trial License or Commercial License with Updates and Support) is determined at the time of the License purchase.  

For purposes of this Agreement:

“Your Integrated Products” are limited to those software applications which: (i) are developed by Your Licensed Developers; (ii) add substantial functionality beyond the functionality provided by the incorporated components of the Software; and (iii) are not commercial alternatives for, or competitive in the marketplace with, the Software or any components of the Software.

“Licensed Developers” (i) are limited to the number of Your employees or contractors authorized by You to use the Software to develop software specifically for You and (ii) must correspond to the maximum number of seats You have purchased from Telerik hereunder. This means that, at any given time, the number of Licensed Developers cannot exceed the number of seats that You have purchased from Telerik and for which You have paid Telerik all applicable License Fees pursuant to this Agreement. The Software is in “use” on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device). Your Licensed Developers may install the Software on multiple machines, so long as the Software is not being used simultaneously for development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than You have seats.

1.1 Trial License

1.1.1 License Grant. If You download the free Trial License, then, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts a license to use the Software for the sole purpose of evaluating its functionality and performance. You are not allowed to integrate the Software into end products or use it for any commercial, productive or training purpose. You may not redistribute the Software. The term of the Trial License shall be 30 days. If You wish to continue using the Software beyond expiration of the Trial License, You must purchase the applicable commercial license.

1.1.2 Support. You are entitled to enter five (5) support requests via Telerik’s ticketing system with a 72 hour response time (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) for thirty (30) days after download of Your initial Trial License.  For avoidance of doubt, You are not entitled to additional support requests for any Trial Licenses downloaded after Your initial download (e.g. to evaluate a different Kendo UI product or a new release), for a period of one (1) year from the date of Your initial download.

1.1.3 Updates. At Telerik’s sole discretion, You may receive minor updates (i.e. service pack updates) for the Software version You are evaluating. You are not eligible to receive major updates (i.e. major revisions to or new versions of the Software) for the Software You are evaluating. Software updates replace and/or supplement (and may disable) the version of the Software that formed the basis for Your eligibility for the update. You may use the resulting updated Software only in accordance with the terms of this Trial License.

1.1.4 THE TRIAL VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ‘AS IS’. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. TELERIK GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, TELERIK EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

1.2 Commercial License with Updates and Support.  If You purchase a Commercial License with Updates and Support, Your Licensed Developers may use the Software in minified and source code form in accordance with Section 1.3 in the development of Your Integrated Products. In addition, for the applicable period of one (1), two (2) or three (3) years from the date on which You purchased the Software, for which You have purchased updates and support (the “Subscription Period”), You will receive minor and major updates for the Software, access to certain source code for the Software, as well as the “Commercial” support package, each as described in further detail below.

1.2.2 Support. During the Subscription Period, You are entitled to the “Commercial” support package as described in greater detail here: http://www.telerik.com/purchase/support-plans/kendo-ui, subject to the limitations and restrictions described in the following Fair Usage Policy. The support services for tickets submitted relating to AngularJS implementations are limited to (i) assistance with plain implementations which include AngularJS and Kendo UI widgets, (ii) assistance with implementations which utilize the Kendo Angular labs project (https://github.com/kendo-labs/angular-kendo) and its directives (project support) or (iii) implementations which require extension of the existing Kendo Angular labs project with new logic.

1.2.2.1 Support Package Fair Usage Policy. Telerik may limit or terminate Your access to any or all of the support services available under the “Commercial” support package if Your use of the support services is determined by Telerik, in its sole and reasonable discretion, to be excessive.

1.2.2.2 In no event will Telerik provide support of any kind to end-users of Your Integrated Products.

1.2.3 Updates. During the Subscription Period, You will be eligible to receive all major and minor updates for the version of the Software that You license hereunder and source code for the Software. Updates replace and/or supplement (and may disable) the version of the Software that formed the basis for Your eligibility for the update. You may use the resulting updated Software only in accordance with the terms of this License.

1.3 Source Code. The Software’s source code is provided to You so that You can create modifications under the terms of this Agreement.

1.3.1 While Telerik does not claim any ownership rights in Your Integrated Products, any modifications You develop to the Software source code will be the exclusive property of Telerik, and You agree to and hereby do assign all right, title and interest in and to such modifications and all rights associated therewith to Telerik.

1.3.2 You will be entitled to use modifications of the Software’s source code developed by You under the terms of this Agreement and Telerik hereby grants You a license to use such modifications pursuant to Section 1.2.

1.3.3 You acknowledge that the Software’s source code is confidential and contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of Telerik. Under no circumstances may any portion of the Software’s source code or any modified version of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party.

1.3.4 Telerik DOES NOT provide technical support for any source code that has been modified by any party other than Telerik.

1.3.5 The Software’s source code is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. Refunds are not available for any licenses that include a right to receive source code.

1.4 Testing and Building License. You may also use the Software in the testing and building of Your Integrated Products. This license is not limited to a number of seats.

2. License Options for Redistribution

2.1 Redistribution under Commercial License. If You have purchased a Commercial License, You may distribute the Programs in minified form as embedded in Your Integrated Products to Your end-users only pursuant to an end-user license that meets the requirements of this Section. You are not permitted to distribute the Software pursuant to this Section: as a standalone product or as a part of any product other than Your Integrated Product. Your end-user license agreement must: prohibit distribution of the Software by Your Authorized End Users; limit the liability of Your licensors or suppliers to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; and prohibit any attempt to disassemble, decompile or “unlock”, decode or otherwise reverse translate or engineer, or attempt in any manner to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying algorithms of the Software. Provided Your Authorized End-Users are in compliance with their license agreements with You, any sublicenses to use the Software granted by You to Your Authorized End-Users will survive any termination of this Agreement or the License set forth herein between You and Telerik. You are not allowed to, and are expressly prohibited from granting Your Authorized End-Users any right to further sublicense the Software.

2.2 Redistribution of Kendo UI Core under Open Source License.

If You do not agree to these additional terms and conditions, You should not download the new products. In case of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions applicable to any new product made available to You as part of any updates, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern.

6. Term and Termination

This Agreement and the License granted hereunder shall continue until terminated in accordance with this Section. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the License granted hereunder shall last as long as You use the Software in compliance with the terms herein. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and without prejudice to Telerik’s other rights or remedies, Telerik shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the License granted hereunder immediately if You breach any of the material terms of this Agreement, and You fail to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from Telerik.  Upon termination of this Agreement, all Licenses granted to You hereunder shall terminate automatically and You shall immediately cease use and distribution of the Software; provided, however, that any sublicenses granted to Your Authorized End-Users in accordance with Section 2 shall survive such termination. You must also destroy (i) all copies of the Software not integrated into a live, functioning instance(s) of Your Integrated Product(s) already installed, implemented and deployed for Your Authorized End-User(s), and (ii) any product and company logos provided by Telerik in connection with this Agreement.

7. Product Discontinuance

Telerik reserves the right to discontinue the Software or any component of the Software, whether offered as a standalone product or solely as a component, at any time.

8. Intellectual Property

All title and ownership rights in and to the Software (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, or text embedded in the Software), the intellectual property embodied in the Software, and any trademarks or service marks of Telerik that are used in connection with the Software are and shall at all times remain exclusively owned by Telerik and its licensors. All title and intellectual property rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the Software is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties. This Agreement grants You no rights to use such content. Any open source software that may be delivered by Telerik embedded in or in association with Telerik products is provided pursuant to the open source license applicable to the software and subject to the disclaimers and limitations on liability set forth in such license. As required by the Common Public License (“CPL”), if a user wishes to obtain the source code for the components licensed under the CPL a user may access them at http://wixtoolset.org.

9. Limited Warranty

Except as specified in Section 1.1.4 (Trial License), Telerik warrants solely to You that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for the Software. Telerik does not warrant the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii) Your failure to follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than Telerik. In the event of a breach of warranty, Your sole and exclusive remedy and Telerik’s sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee’s sole remedy and Telerik’s maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is only valid if Telerik receives written notice of breach of warranty no later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9, TELERIK DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Telerik be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based. In any case, Telerik’s entire liability under any provision of this Agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to Telerik for the Software giving rise to such damages, or in the case of a Trial license shall not exceed $5, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable. Telerik is not responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the Software and/or any material linked through such content. Any data included in the Software upon shipment from Telerik is for testing use only and Telerik hereby disclaims any and all liability arising therefrom.

11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Telerik and its resellers from and against any and all claims, lawsuits and proceedings (collectively “Claims”), and all expenses, costs (including attorney's fees), judgments, damages and other liabilities resulting from such Claims, that arise or result from (i) Your use of the Software in violation of this Agreement, (ii) the use or distribution of Your Integrated Product or (iii) Your modification of the Software’s source code.

Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement. However, neither party shall have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that (i) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (ii) the disclosing party has disclosed to a third party without any obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (iii) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure and complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall treat any source code for the Programs as confidential information and shall not disclose, disseminate or distribute such materials to any third party without Telerik’s prior written permission. Each party’s obligations under this Section 12 shall apply at all times during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years following termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code shall survive in perpetuity and (ii) trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.

13. Governing Law

This Agreement will be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.
