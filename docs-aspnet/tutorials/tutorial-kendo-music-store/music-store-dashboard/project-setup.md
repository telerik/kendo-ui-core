# Set Up the Project

## Handle the Database

The Kendo UI Music Store Dashboard demo application uses an SQL Server database with sample data for artists, albums, orders, etc.

To populate the sample database, the application uses Entity Framework Code First migrations to create the database and seed the sample data. The migrations are configured to only run in the `Debug` mode. If you run it in the `Release` mode, the code assumes that the database is already created and does not try to create or seed the data.

The connection string configured in the `web.config` file is set to use `LocalDB` and will connect to a local database file in the `App_Data` folder. `LocalDB` requires an SQL Server 2012 or later.

To run the Kendo UI Music Store Dashboard demo, make sure your system meets these requirements or change the connection string to use an SQL Server instance available on your computer.
