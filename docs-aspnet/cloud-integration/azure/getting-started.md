# Creating a Microsoft Azure Account

To create a Microsoft Azure account, navigate to the [Microsoft Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/). You can use your Microsoft account to create an Azure account, or your GitHub account as well. The process is straightforward and takes several steps to complete. Choosing between a free account or a pay-as-you-go account is possible, with details on the available tiers present on Microsoft's website.

Refer to Microsoft's [Create an Azure account tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/), if a step-by-step guideline is required.
