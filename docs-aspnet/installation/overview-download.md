# Download and Installation Overview
This article lists the different approaches for installing Progress® Telerik® UI for ASP.NET Core.

## Requirements

Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core requires .NET Core. To install .NET core, follow the instructions on [Microsoft's .NET Core documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites).

## Download and Installation

To download and install Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core, you can use either of the following approaches:

* The [Windows MSI installer package]({% slug msi_install_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}) comes with a standard setup wizard. The setup wizard installs the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core server-side packages and the client-side resources. The MSI allows you to chose whether to install the offline version of the [Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Demos](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-core) and the [Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Visual Studio extensions]({% slug overview_visualstudio_aspnetcore %}). There is also an option that configures the Telerik NuGet feed for you.
* [NuGet]({% slug nuget_install_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}) allows you to install only the packages that you need for your project. The Telerik Nuget feed is available only to registered users because it requires authentication.
* [NPM]({% slug npmpackages_core %}) offers another way to install the needed packages for your project. 
* [Bower]({% slug bowerpackage_core %}) was a popular package manager but starting with ASP.NET Core v2.1 it is no longer supported.
