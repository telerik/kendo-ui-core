# Providing Client-Side Resources

This article outlines the approaches for adding the Kendo client-side assets to your application.

The {{ site.product }} suite is a set of server-side wrappers over the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui" target="_blank">Kendo UI for jQuery client-side widgets</a>. To use the {{ site.product_short }} components in an application, you need not only the [binaries]({% slug downloadinstall_aspnetcore %}) that enable you to use the {% if site.core %}TagHelpers and HtmlHelpers{% else %}HtmlHelpers{% endif %}, but also the required JavaScript and CSS client-side web assets. 

## Available Approaches

You can use the following methods for adding the Kendo client-side resources to your project: 

* Using local files

    You can provide the client-side assets by downloading the required JavaScript and CSS files from the Telerik website and then copying them in your project. For the detailed step-by-step procedure, see the [Using Local Files]({% slug using_local_client_side_resources %}) article.

{% if site.core %}
* Using LibMan

    The LibMan client-side library management tool allows you to fetch the Kendo UI client-side files that are distributed as NPM packages and place them in a folder within your ASP.NET Core project. The scripts in the NPM packages are not usable in the browser. This requires you to use a bundler such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">WebPack</a>. For the detailed step-by-step procedure, see the [Using LibMan]({% slug using_libman %}) article.
{% endif %}

* Using CDN

    The Kendo UI client-side resources like JavaScript files and CSS files are available online through the Kendo CDN service. This allows you to configure your project to import the client-side resources directly from the CDN. For more details, see the [Using CDN]({% slug cdnservices_core %}) article.

## Creating Custom Script Bundles

{% if site.core %}
Depending on the Telerik UI components that you use in your project, you may need lighter scripts that support only the components in your application. You have the choice to select scripts for individual components or to create your custom scripts. For more details, see [Creating Your Own Custom Script Bundles]({% slug custombundles_core %}).

{% else %}
Depending on the Telerik UI components that you use in your project, you may need only the scripts that support the components in your application. To identify the scripts that you must include in your application, check the documents under [**Installation** > **Providing Client-Side Resources** > **Creating Custom Script Bundles**]({% slug custombundles_core %}). For example, to find out what scripts are required to use the Telerik UI Charts, see the [Individual Scripts for Charts]({% slug script_filesfor_charts_widgets %}) document.

Clients with a commercial license can use the [Custom Download Builder tool](https://www.telerik.com/download/custom-download) to create a single JavaScript file which contains the dependencies only for the required widgets and features.

> * Do not use multiple custom combined scripts, as they will contain duplicate code. Instead, create one combined script file, which includes everything you need.
> * Do not use RequireJS to load Download Builder packages because the tool will not create the required AMD modules.
> * Make sure the `Server Wrappers` checkbox is checked&mdash;this will include the scripts required by the wrappers.
