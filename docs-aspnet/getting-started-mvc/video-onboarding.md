# Video Onboarding

Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC has its [own video getting started curriculum](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/3/telerik-ui-for-aspnet-mvc) available to both active trial users and active license holders in [Virtual Classroom](https://learn.telerik.com/learn). The training course is developed to help you get started with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components and features. It aims to put you in the shoes of an engineer who adds new features to an existing application.

The process starts by adding basic Telerik UI components and widgets to the application and shows how to harness the power of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC controls and features in no time. Further on, you'll get into more advanced components, like the Chart and the Grid, and learn how to incorporate Telerik UI components to interact with existing functionality and with each other. Finally, the course will explore how to build your own theme and change it for all components at once.
