## Environment

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Product</td>
  <td>{{ site.product }}</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Progress {{ site.product }} version</td>
  <td>2023.1.314</td>
 </tr>
</table>

## Description


I was using the following Kendo JS and CSS links before upgrading {{ site.product }}:

```
    https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2022.2.802/styles/kendo.bootstrap-main.min.css
```

However, as of the the latest `R1 2023 SP1` release, these resources seem to be obsolete. How can I reference the themes from the CDN?

## Solution

As of version `R1 2023 SP1`, the CDN has a new structure where it is composed of:

* Theme version&mdash;for example, `7.0.2`.
* Theme name&mdash;for example, `default`, `bootstrap`, `material`, and so on.
* File name&mdash;is the name of the theme.

The following example shows the new structure of the Kendo CDN resources:

```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/themes/7.0.2/bootstrap/bootstrap-main.css" />
```
