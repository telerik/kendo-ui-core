# Playlists

The Telerik UI for {{ site.framework }} MediaPlayer enables you to create your own playlists and to enable or disable the seeking forward.

## Creating Playlists

Players usually feature a different video based on user action. To implement your own **Playlist** structures, change the source of the MediaPlayer dynamically. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on creating your own playlists in the MediaPlayer](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/mediaplayer/playlist) which uses the ListView to create a list that holds the videos right next to the MediaPlayer element.

To change the existing source of the MediaPlayer, use the MediaPlayer client-side [`media()`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/mediaplayer/methods/media) method.

```
    <script>
        function buttonClick() {
            var player = $("#mediaplayer").data("kendoMediaPlayer");
            player.media({
                title: "Our Company Culture - Lesson 2",
                source: "Video/video2.mp4"
            });
        }
    </script>    
```

## Seeking Forward

Some applications enforce the user to watch only the currently loaded content without the option to jump forward. The MediaPlayer provides the [`ForwardSeek()`](https://docs.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/api/kendo.mvc.ui.fluent/mediaplayerbuilder#forwardseeksystemboolean) configuration method, which helps you to achieve this requirement.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().MediaPlayer()
        .Name("mediaPlayer")
        .AutoPlay(true)
        .ForwardSeek(true)
    )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
    <kendo-mediaplayer name="mediaPlayer"
        auto-play="true"
        forward-seek="true"
    </kendo-mediaplayer>
```
{% endif %}
