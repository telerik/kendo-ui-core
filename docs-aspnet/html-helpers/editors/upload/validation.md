# File Validation

The Upload supports file validation&mdash;selected files can be validated against their extensions and size.

## Types of Validation

The Upload supports three types of validation:

* [File extension](#file-extension)
* [Maximum file size](#maximum-file-size)
* [Minimum file size](#minimum-file-size)

The following example demonstrates a sample configuration for all the three types of validation.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().Upload()
        .Name("files")
        .Async(a => a
            .Save("ChunkSave", "Upload")
            .Remove("Remove", "Upload")
        )
        .Validation(validation => validation
            .AllowedExtensions(new string[] { ".gif", ".jpg", ".png" })
            .MaxFileSize(31457280)
            .MinFileSize(30720)
        )
    )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
    @{
        string[] extensions = { ".gif", ".jpg", ".png" };
    }
    
    <kendo-upload name="files">
        <async save-url="@Url.Action("ChunkSave","Upload")" remove-url="@Url.Action("Remove","Upload")" />
        <validation allowed-extensions="@extensions" max-file-size="31457280" min-file-size="30720" />
    </kendo-upload>
```
{% endif %}

### File Extension

The `AllowedExtensions()`, which accepts an array of strings listing all file extensions that are allowed. If the user tries to select a file with an extension that is not included in the array, the validation will fail.

### Maximum File Size

The `MaxFileSize()` configuration defines the maximum size in bytes allowed of a file that is intended for upload to the server. If the selected file exceeds the maximum size, a validation error message, such as `File size too large.`, is displayed.

### Minimum File Size

Similarly, the `MinFileSize()` method defines the minimum size in bytes allowed of a file that is intended for upload to the server. If the size of the selected file is less than the minimum size, a validation error message, such as `File size too small.`, is displayed.

## Browser Limitations

Internet Explorer versions prior to version 10 provide no information on the file size. As a result, the Upload validation for the `MinFileSize()` and `MaxFileSize()` options will not work as expected.
