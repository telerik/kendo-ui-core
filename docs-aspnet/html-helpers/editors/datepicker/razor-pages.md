# Telerik UI DatePicker in RazorPages

`RazorPage` is an alternative to the MVC pattern that makes page-focused coding easier and more productive. It consists of a `cshtml` file and a `cs` file (generally the two files have the same name). The Telerik UI DatePicker for {{ site.framework }} can be integrated in such an application seamlessly.

For a runnable example, you can refer to the following DateTimePicker sample, which in this case applies for the DatePicker widget as well in the same fashion:
