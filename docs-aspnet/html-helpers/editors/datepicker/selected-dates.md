# Selected Dates

The DatePicker allows you to render a pre-selected date and also define the minimum and maximum dates it displays.

For a complete example on how to select ranges using DatePicker, refer to the [demo on range selection](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/datepicker/rangeselection).

> {{ site.product }} includes the [DateRangePicker]({% slug htmlhelpers_daterangepicker_aspnetcore %}) component that can be used for selecting date ranges.

The following example demonstrates how to render a DatePicker with an initially selected date and defined min and max dates. The DatePicker sets the value only if the entered date is within the defined range and is valid.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().DatePicker()
        .Name("datepicker")
        .Value(new DateTime(2019, 5, 15))
        .Min(new DateTime(2019, 5, 10))
        .Min(new DateTime(2019, 6, 18))
    )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
<kendo-datepicker name="datepicker"
                  week-number="true"
                  value="new DateTime(2019, 5, 15)"
                  min="new DateTime(2019, 5, 15)"
                  max="new DateTime(2019,6,18)" />
```
{% endif %}
