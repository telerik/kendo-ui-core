# Selected Dates

The DateTimePicker allows you to render a pre-selected date and also define the minimum and maximum dates it displays.

For a complete example on how to select ranges by using the DateTimePicker, refer to the [demo on range selection](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/datetimepicker/rangeselection).

> {{ site.product }} includes the [DateRangePicker]({% slug htmlhelpers_daterangepicker_aspnetcore %}) component that can be used for selecting date ranges.

The following example demonstrates how to render a DateTimePicker with an initially selected date and defined min and max dates. The DateTimePicker sets the value only if the entered date is within the defined range and is valid.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().DateTimePicker()
        .Name("dateTimePicker")
        .Value(DateTime.Now)
        .Min(new DateTime(1950, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0))
        .Max(new DateTime(2050, 1, 1, 20, 0, 0))
    )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
    <kendo-datetimepicker name="dateTimePicker"
        value="DateTime.Now"
        min="new DateTime(1950, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0)" 
        max="new DateTime(2050, 1, 1, 20, 0, 0)"/>
```
{% endif %}
