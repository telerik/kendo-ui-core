## WAI-ARIA

The component follows the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for implementing the keyboard navigation for its component role and is tested against the popular screen readers.

To customize the `aria-label` text of the currently focused cell in the calendar, use the [`ARIATemplate`](/api/kendo.mvc.ui.fluent/datetimepickerbuilder#ariatemplatesystemstring) configuration option.

The DateTimePicker is compliant with the Section 508 requirements. For more information, refer to the article on [Section 508 support in {{ site.product }}]({% slug overview_accessibility %}#section-508).
