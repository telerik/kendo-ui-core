# Disable Dates

The DateRangePicker allows you to disable specific days which are not intended to be selected by the end user such as weekends and national holidays.

To disable a date in the DateRangePicker, use either of the following approaches:

* [Set an array of dates](#setting-an-array)
* [Add a function](#adding-a-function)

## Setting an Array

To disable dates by setting an array, list the names of the days that will be disabled by using the first letters from their names in English.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().DateRangePicker()
        .Name("dateRangePicker")
        .DisableDates(new[] {"we", "th" })
    )
```

## Adding a Function

To disable dates by using a function, set the return value for the date that will be disabled to `true`.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().DateRangePicker()
        .Name("dateRangePicker")
        .DisableDates("disableDatesHandler")
    )

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function disableDatesHandler(date) {
            var disabled = [13, 14, 20, 21];
            if (date && disabled.indexOf(date.getDate()) > -1) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    </script>
```
