# Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Editor is enabled through:

1. Adding a reference to the specific culture file:

    ```
        <script src="@Url.Content("~/lib/kendo/js/cultures/kendo.culture.bg-BG.min.js")"></script>
    ```

1. Apply the culture to all Telerik UI components:

    ```
        <script type="text/javascript">
            //set the Kendo UI culture
            kendo.culture("@culture");
        </script> 
    ```

> The `culture()` method has to be called before the declaration of the Telerik UI components
