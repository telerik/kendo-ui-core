# Keyboard Navigation

The MultiSelect also follows the [WAI-ARIA best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) for implementing the [keyboard navigation](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/multiselect/keyboard-navigation) for its component role and is tested against the popular screen readers.

The keyboard navigation of the MultiSelect is always available. For a complete example, refer to the [demo on keyboard navigation of the MultiSelect](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/multiselect/keyboard-navigation).
