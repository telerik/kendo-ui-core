# ListBox Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support). More information could be found here:

* [Localization of messages]({% slug htmlhelpers_listbox_localization_aspnetcore %})
* [Right-to-left support]({% slug htmlhelpers_listbox_rtl_aspnetcore %})

For more information on using localization and right-to-left languages with {{ site.product }} components, refer to the article on [globalization support by {{ site.product }}]({% slug overview_globalization_core %}).
