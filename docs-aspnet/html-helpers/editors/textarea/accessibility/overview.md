# TextArea Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} TextArea provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The TextArea is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AAA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=textbox` or `nodeName=textarea` | Describes the role of the component. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input requires an accessible name that will be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-required=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TextArea is in a `form` HTML element and announces the required state of the component. |
|  | `aria-describedby=.k-form-hint id/.k-form-error id` | Points to the hint for the input, or if the input is invalid, to the error message. This attribute should only be present when a hint is set or when the input is invalid. |
|  | `aria-multiline=true` | Announces the multi-line behavior of the TextArea. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TextArea is in a form and announces the valid state of the component. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TextArea is disabled. |
