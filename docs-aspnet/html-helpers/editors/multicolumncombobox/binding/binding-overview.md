# Data Binding Overview

The {{ site.product }} MultiColumnComboBox provides flexible data binding capabilities that allow you to populate the dropdown list with multi-column data from various sources. You can choose the appropriate binding method based on your application architecture and data requirements.

## Data Binding Approaches

The MultiColumnComboBox supports the following data binding methods:

### Local Data Binding

Bind the MultiColumnComboBox to a local dataset by passing an arbitrary model directly within the boundaries of the component. This approach is optimal for:
- Small to medium-sized datasets that can be loaded in memory.
- Filtering the data on the client.
- Scenarios where all data is available at render time.

For detailed implementation instructions, see [Local Data Binding]({% slug htmlhelpers_multicolumncombobox_serverbinding_aspnetcore %}) documentation.

### Remote Data Binding

Connect the MultiColumnComboBox to a remote endpoint using AJAX requests. This enables:
- Dynamic data loading and filtering as the user types.
- Real-time data updates from external sources.
- Improved performance with large datasets through [server-side filtering]({% slug filtering_multicolumncombobox_aspnetcore %}) or [data virtualization]({% slug virtualization_multicolumncombobox_aspnetcore %}).

For more information and examples, refer to the [Remote Data Binding]({% slug htmlhelpers_multicolumncombobox_ajaxbinding_aspnetcore %}) documentation.

### Custom DataSource Binding

Implement custom data binding scenarios with full control over the data retrieval process:
- Custom data processing logic based on the remote server structure and requirements.
- Custom data operations such as filtering and grouping.
- Connection to [OData](https://www.odata.org/) or other external services.

For more information, refer to the [Custom DataSource Binding]({% slug custombinding_multicolumncombobox_aspnetmvc %}) documentation.

### Model Binding

Bind the MultiColumnComboBox to model properties using strongly-typed expressions (for example, `MultiColumnComboBoxFor(m => m.PropertyName)`) for form scenarios that require server-side validation, model state management, and seamless integration with [Data Annotation attributes]({% slug validation_aspnetmvc%}#using-dataannotation-attributes).

For more information, refer to the [Model Binding]({% slug modelbinding_multicolumncombobox_aspnetmvc %}) documentation.

## Data Binding in Razor Pages

You can seamlessly integrate the MultiColumnComboBox component into Razor Pages applications. All the [data binding approaches](#data-binding-approaches) described above can be configured within Razor Pages scenarios.

The component supports both HtmlHelper and TagHelper syntax, and allows you to send the anti-forgery token when connecting to remote endpoints to ensure secure data operations.

For detailed implementation instructions, refer to the [Razor Pages Binding]({% slug htmlhelpers_multicolumncombobox_razorpage_aspnetcore %}) article.

## Key Considerations

When selecting a data binding approach for the MultiColumnComboBox, evaluate the following factors:

* **Performance**&mdash;Local data binding offers faster initial rendering, while remote data binding provides better performance with large datasets through on-demand loading.
* **Data volume**&mdash;Large datasets are better handled with remote data binding and server-side filtering, while small to medium datasets work well with local data binding.
* **Real-time requirements**&mdash;Remote data binding is essential for scenarios requiring live data updates and dynamic content refresh.
* **Form integration**&mdash;Model binding is optimal when working with strongly-typed forms that require validation and model state management.
* **Custom scenarios**&mdash;Custom DataSource binding provides full control for complex data operations, OData integration, or specialized server architectures.
* **Maintenance**&mdash;Local data binding is simpler for static data, while remote data binding offers more flexibility for evolving data requirements.
