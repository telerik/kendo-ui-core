# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the Catpcha is always available. The underlying HTML elements of the widget have `tabindex` attributes that the elements are tabbed in the correct order.

For a complete example, refer to the [demo on keyboard navigation of the Captcha](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/captcha/keyboard-navigation).
