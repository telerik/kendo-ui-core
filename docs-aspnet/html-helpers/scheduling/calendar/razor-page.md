# Telerik UI Calendar in RazorPages

`RazorPage` is an alternative to the MVC pattern that makes page-focused coding easier and more productive. It consists of a `cshtml` file and a `cs` file (generally the two files have the same name). The Telerik UI Calendar for {{ site.framework }} can be integrated in such an application seamlessly.

For a runnable example, refer to the [Calendar in RazorPages example](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-core-examples/tree/master/Telerik.Examples.RazorPages/Telerik.Examples.RazorPages/Pages/Calendar).
