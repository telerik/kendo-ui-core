# Selection

The Calendar enables the user to make single, multiple, range-date, and week selections.

For a runnable example, refer to [the demo on multiple selection in the Calendar component](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/calendar/selection).

## Single Date Selection

By default, the Calendar enables the user to select a single date by using the mouse or the keyboard.

> As of the 2022 R3 release, the [`Change`](https://docs.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/api/kendo.mvc.ui.fluent/calendareventbuilder#changesystemstring) event will now be fired only when Selection/Deselection is performed.

## Multiple Date Selection

As of the 2017 R3 release, the Calendar allows you to implement the multiple date selection by using the `selectable` configuration property.

To perform the multiple date selection, the user can also use the keyboard:

* `Ctrl` + mouse-clicking a specific date&mdash;Marks the date as selected. Other previously selected dates remain selected.
* The selection of a date from a specific view without utilizing the `Ctrl` key selects the date of the clicked cell and deselects all previously selected dates including the previously selected dates from other views or months.
* The selection of a date that is already selected while holding the `Ctrl` key removes the date from the selection.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().Calendar()
        .Name("calendar")
        .Selectable("multiple")
       )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
    <kendo-calendar name="calendar" selectable="multiple">
    </kendo-calendar>
```
{% endif %}

## Range Date Selection

The Calendar enables the range date selection over the keyboard.

The usage of the `Shift` key allows the user to select a range of dates in the same month or across different months:

* `Shift` + mouse-clicking specific dates&mdash;Selects all dates between the most recently selected one (with `Space` or mouse click) and the clicked cell.
* `Shift` + mouse clicking specific dates&mdash;If no previous selection was made, selects all dates from the beginning to the clicked cell.

## Week Selection

When the user clicks a specific week number, the Calendar selects the entire week. The week selection functionality is a special case of range selection which starts from the first day of the week and selects all dates to the end of the week.
