# Calendar Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Calendar is enabled through:
* [Localization of messages]({% slug localization_calendar_aspnetcore %})
* [Right-to-left support]({% slug rtl_calendar_aspnetcore %})

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-introduction.html %}
{% endif %}
