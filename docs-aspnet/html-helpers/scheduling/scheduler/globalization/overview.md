# Scheduler Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Scheduler is enabled through:

* [Localization of messages]({% slug localization_scheduler%})
* [Right-to-left support]({% slug rtl_scheduler %})
