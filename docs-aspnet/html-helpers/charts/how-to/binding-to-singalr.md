# Bind to SignalR Hubs

The Data Source component used by the Chart supports binding to a SignalR hub and subscribing to push notifications.

To see the example, refer to the GitHub repo with the [sample project of a SignalR-bound Chart](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/chart/signalr-bound-chart).
