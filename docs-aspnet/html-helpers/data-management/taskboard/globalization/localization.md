# Localization

Localization is the process of adapting software to meet the requirements of local markets and different languages.

To translate the messages of the TaskBoard, use either of the following approaches:

* Register a script before the initialization of the TreeList itself, for example, `<script src="https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/<version>/js/messages/kendo.messages.es-ES.min.js"></script>`.
* Reference a local file, for example, `<script src="~/lib/kendo-ui/js/cultures/kendo.messages.es-ES.min.js"></script>`.
