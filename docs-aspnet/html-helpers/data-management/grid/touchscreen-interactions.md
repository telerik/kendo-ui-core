# Touchscreen Interactions

The Grid enables you to use gestures to activate its functionalities.

## Editing

When the [Editing Mode](% slug htmlhelpers_grid_aspnetcore_editing_overview %) of the Grid is configured to `InCell`, use `double-tap` to activate a cell for editing in mobile devices.

## Selection

The Selection functionality on mobile devices includes the following gestures:

* Multiple selection with `tap` toggles the selected row or cell.
* Multiple selection with the marquee tool requires `hold` & `slide` to activate. It indicates `hold` when selecting the row or cell.

## Drag and Drop

The Row Drag and Drop on mobile devices activates on `hold` & `slide` of the row.
