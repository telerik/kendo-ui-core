# Adaptive Rendering

The Telerik UI Grid for {{ site.framework }} provides consistency to the customer experience on any device by supporting adaptive enhancements.

For example, when you filter or edit data on mobile, the system slides in a new screen for the user, which is a departure from the desktop-like inline and popup behaviors. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on implementing the responsive web design in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/grid/adaptive-rendering).

## Enabling the Responsive Web Design

To enable the adaptive rendering feature, set the [`Mobile`](https://docs.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/api/Kendo.Mvc.UI.Fluent/GridBuilder#mobile) property to `MobileMode.Auto` or `MobileMode.Phone`:

* If set to `MobileMode.Auto`, the component will use adaptive rendering when viewed on a mobile browser.
* If set to `MobileMode.Phone`, the component will be forced to use adaptive rendering regardless of the browser type.

> Important: With the mobile rendering, we recommend to set up `height` as well. Without setting an explicit height, every view of the grid might have a different height.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().Grid<ProductViewModel>()
        .Name("grid")
        .Mobile()
        .HtmlAttributes(new { style = "height:450px;" })
        .DataSource(dataSource => dataSource
            .Ajax()
            .Read(read => read.Action("Products_Read", "Home"))
        )
    )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
<kendo-grid name="grid"
            mobile-enabled="true"
            height="450">
    <datasource type="DataSourceTagHelperType.Ajax">
        <transport>
            <read url="@Url.Action("Products_Read", "Home")"/>
        </transport>
    </datasource>

</kendo-grid>
```
{% endif %}

## Resizing Columns

The column resizing feature on touch screen devices is triggered when the user holds a finger on the respective column header. When the resizing icon appears, the user can resize the column by dragging.

## Destroying Adaptive Grids

When the Grid is in its adaptive rendering mode, it generates auxiliary markup which needs to be removed if the Grid is to be `destroyed` manually.

To manually destroy the Grid:

1. Call the Kendo UI for jQuery [`kendo.destroy()`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/kendo/methods/destroy) method over the closest `.k-pane-wrapper` ancestor which is created around the Grid.
1. Remove the whole `.k-pane-wrapper` element from the DOM.
