# Apply Dates that Ignore Timezones

Use the property of the model that should ignore the timezone. Set the value of the property as UTC time by using its ticks. Here is an example:

```
    public class Person
    {
        public int PersonID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        private DateTime birthDate;
        public DateTime BirthDate
        {
            get { return this.birthDate; }
            set
            {
                this.birthDate = new DateTime(value.Ticks, DateTimeKind.Utc);
            }

        }
    }
```

What the code does in reality is to convert a standard DateTime value coming through `value.Ticks` and make it in UTC format using the `DateTimeKind.Utc` configuration parameter.
