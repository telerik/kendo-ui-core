# Configure Ajax Editing with Localized Enumerations

To see the example, refer to the project on how to [create a column bound to an `enum` field displaying localized texts for corresponding values](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/grid-enum-editing-with-dropdownlist-enum-localization).

The demo also shows how to edit this column using a DropDownList.
