# Export to Excel Server-Side

> The approach demonstrated in this article is now deprecated in favor of the [server-side processing concept]({% slug excelexport_gridhelper_aspnetcore %}#use-server-side-processing).

The following example demonstrates how to export the Kendo UI Grid data as an Excel document by implementing it through the NPOI open-source library as well as the Microsoft OpenXML SDK.

To see the example, refer to the project on how to [export to Excel on the server side](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/excel-export-server-side).
