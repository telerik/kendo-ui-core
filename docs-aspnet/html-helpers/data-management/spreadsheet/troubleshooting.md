# Troubleshooting

This article provides solutions for common issues you may encounter while working with the Telerik UI Spreadsheet component for {{ site.framework }}.

## Processing fails for files with small amount of data

The conversion and processing can hang or fail even if the Spreadsheet file does not contain a lot of data. Even cells that appear empty are processed if they have a non-default styling.

**Solution** Reset all cells outside the used range to the default borders, formatting and colors.
