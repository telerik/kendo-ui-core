# PDF Export

As of the 2015 Q1 release, the PivotGrid HtmlHelper provides a built-in PDF export functionality.

By default, PDF export is enabled when `kendo.all.min.js`, `kendo.web.min.js`, or a custom build that includes PDF scripts is loaded to the page.

To initiate PDF export by using code, call the [`saveAsPDF`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/pivotgrid/methods/saveaspdf) method.

For more information, refer to the following resources:
* [Configuring the export to PDF](/api/Kendo.Mvc.UI.Fluent/PivotGridBuilder)
* [Exporting the PivotGrid to PDF (demo)](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/pivotgrid/pdf-export)

To customize the appearance of the exported PDF file, refer to the articles on the [PDF output by the Kendo UI Drawing library](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/drawing/pdf-output/overview).
