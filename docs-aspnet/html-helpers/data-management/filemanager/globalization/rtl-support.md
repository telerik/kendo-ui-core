# Right-to-Left Support

Right-to-left (RTL) support reflects the ability of a widget to render its content in a right-to-left direction for right-to-left languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, or Japanese.

For more information, refer to the [demo on RTL support by the FileManager component for {{ site.framework }}](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/filemanager/right-to-left-support).
