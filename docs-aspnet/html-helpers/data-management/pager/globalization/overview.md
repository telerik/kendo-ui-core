# Pager Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Pager is enabled through the [localization of its messages]({% slug localization_pager_aspnet %}).

For more information on using localization and right-to-left languages with {{ site.product }} helpers, refer to the article on [globalization support by {{ site.product }}]({% slug overview_globalization_core %}).
