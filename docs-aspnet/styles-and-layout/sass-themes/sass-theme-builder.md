# Telerik UI for {{ site.product }} ThemeBuilder: Overview

[ThemeBuilder](https://www.telerik.com/themebuilder) is a web application that enables you to create your custom styles and to apply them to the UI components in your Telerik UI for {{ site.product }} apps. 

With [the ThemeBuilder application](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com), you can create new themes, customize existing ones, and organize them in projects. You are in full control of the appearance of every Telerik UI for {{ site.product }} component while, at the same time, you can apply large-scale updates in seconds. To speed up the customization of your {{ site.product }} app, the ThemeBuilder preview visualizes every style change almost instantly.

> Starting with 2023 R1 SP1, ThemeBuilder is accessible from a [new URL](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com). This new ThemeBuilder version replaces the previous ThemeBuilder and provides more free features and a Pro tier. All your existing custom themes will continue to work in the new ThemeBuilder.  

To learn more about using ThemeBuilder, visit the [ThemeBuilder documentation portal](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder), where you can find detailed information on various topics, for example:

## Implementing Design Requirements for {{ site.product }} Apps

If you work with designers, ThemeBuilder allows you to style the Telerik UI for {{ site.product }} components exactly as required by your application's design and to apply your brand colors.

To improve the collaboration between designers and developers, Telerik UI for {{ site.product }} comes with [four UI Kits for Figma]({% slug figma_kits_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}): Material, Bootstrap, Fluent, and Telerik UI Default. Your designers will use them to create the required application design and to apply your brand colors. To implement these design requirements, you need to create a new theme in ThemeBuilder and customize it:

1. Request from the designer to send you a link to the UI kit with the customized colors in Figma.
1. Use the link to open the design in Figma.
   >If you don't have a Figma account, you can create one for free.
1. Navigate to the **Components** page and locate the **Color Styles** in the [Inspect Panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055203533-Use-the-Inspect-panel), where you can find the values of all colors used in the design.

1. Create a new project in the ThemeBuilder application. To choose the most suitable starting **Theme**, ask your designer which UI Kit was used: **Default**, **Bootstrap**, **Material**, or **Fluent**.
1. Copy the color codes from the **Color Styles** in Figma and paste them in the ThemeBuilder color editor with the same name. For example, copy the value of the `$kendo-primary` color in Figma and paste it in the **Primary** color editor in ThemeBuilder.
