## Rendering

Starting with version R1 2022, the component has a new rendering. For additional information on the decision behind these changes, visit the [Components Rendering Overview]({%slug components_rendering_overview%}) article.

To review the latest rendering of the component, refer to the HTML specifications in the [Kendo UI Themes Monorepo](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/tree/develop). The `tests` folder of the repository contains the rendering for all flavors of the components, providing a clear reference for how their elements are structured. The rendering information can help you customize a component's appearance and behavior by applying custom CSS or JavaScript to suit specific design or functional requirements.
