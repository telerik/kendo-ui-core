#json-serialization-note

>tipThe default casing for JSON strings in ASP.NET Core is camelCase. The Telerik UI components that are data-bound depend on PascalCase formatted response from the server. If the JSON serialization isn't configured properly, the UI components will display wrong data. To find out how to configure the application to return the data in Pascal-case, refer to the [JSON Serialization]({%slug jsonserialization_core%}) article.
