## Telerik REPL for ASP.NET Core

[Telerik REPL](https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-core-ui/repl) is a server playground tool that allows you to write razor/C# code in the browser, see the result, and share your code. It is integrated with the [Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core demos](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-core/), which lets you modify a demo and immediately see the effect of your changes.

Telerik REPL saves you time—it requires no setup and has no prerequisites. You can use it to test various simple scenarios or scenarios of medium complexity. REPL is particularly useful when you need to quickly test something in your browser, for example:
