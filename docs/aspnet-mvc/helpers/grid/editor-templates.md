# Editor Templates

## Introduction

Kendo Grid for ASP.NET MVC relies on ASP.NET MVC editor templates to create the editing UI. If the grid is configured for
in-line or in-cell editing the [Html.EditorFor](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.html.editorextensions.editorfor.aspx) method
is used to get the editor HTML for every property which is editable. So for this configuration:

    Html.Kendo().Grid<Order>()
        .Name("Grid")
        .Columns(columns =>
        {
            columns.Bound(o => o.OrderDate);
            columns.Bound(o => o.ShipCountry);
        })
        .Editable(editable => editable.Mode(GridEditMode.InLine))

the following code will be used to get the editor HTML for the `OrderDate` and `ShipCountry` properties:

    Html.EditorFor(o => o.OrderDate);
    Html.EditorFor(o => o.ShipCountry);

If the grid is configured for pop-up editing the [Html.EditorForModel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.html.editorextensions.editorformodel.aspx) is
used to get the editor HTML for the whole model.

A lot of additional info about ASP.NET MVC editor templates can be found in the [ASP.NET MVC 2 Templates](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/aspnet-mvc-2-templates-part-1-introduction.html) blog post series.

## Create Custom Editor for a Bound Property

Often there is need to create a custom editor for a specific property. For example show a dropdownlist which contains all available values a property can take.

This is done by creating an editor template for that property:

1. Consider the following models which represents the Order and Employee entities from the Northwind database:

        public class Order
        {
            public int OrderID { get; set; }

            public string ShipCountry { get; set; }

            public Employee Employee { get; set; }
        }

        public class Employee
        {
            public int EmployeeID { get; set; }

            public string EmployeeName { get; set; }
        }

2. Let's create an editor template for the `Employee` property which will display a Kendo DropDownList with all available employees. Add a new partial view
to the **~/Views/Shared/EditorTemplates** folder e.g. `EmployeeEditor.ascx` or `EmployeeEditor.cshtml` (if using the Razor view engine).
3. Add a Kendo DropDownList to that partial view. Set the `Name` of the DropDownList to the name of the property which will be edited - `"Employee"` in this case:
    - Razor

            @(Html.Kendo().DropDownList()
                .Name("Employee") // Name of the widget should be the same as the name of the property
                .DataValueField("EmployeeID") // The value of the dropdown is taken from the EmployeeID property
                .DataTextField("EmployeeName") // The text of the items is taken from the EmployeeName property
                .BindTo((System.Collections.IEnumerable)ViewData["employees"]) // A list of all employees which is populated in the controller
            )
    - WebForms

            <%: Html.Kendo().DropDownList()
                .Name("Employee") // Name of the widget should be the same as the name of the property
                .DataValueField("EmployeeID") // The value of the dropdown is taken from the EmployeeID property
                .DataTextField("EmployeeName") // The text of the items is taken from the EmployeeName property
                .BindTo((System.Collections.IEnumerable)ViewData["employees"]) // A list of all employees which is populated in the controller
            %>
4. In the action method (which renders the view that contains the grid) populate the ViewData with a list of all employees:

        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            ViewData["employees"] = new NorthwindDataContext()
                         .Employees
                         .Select(e => new Employee
                         {
                              EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID,
                              EmployeeName = e.FirstName + " " + e.LastName
                         })
                         .OrderBy(e => e.EmployeeName);

            return View();
        }
5. Decorate the `Employee` property with the [UIHint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc679268) attribute. It needs the name of the editor template created in
step 3 sans the extension i.e. `"EmployeeEditor"`.

        public class Order
        {
            public int OrderID { get; set; }

            public string ShipCountry { get; set; }

            [UIHint("EmployeeEditor")]
            public Employee Employee { get; set; }
        }
