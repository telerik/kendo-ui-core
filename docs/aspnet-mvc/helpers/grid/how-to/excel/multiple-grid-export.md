# Export Multiple Grids to Excel

The example below demonstrates how to export two Kendo UI Grids to the same Excel document. Each Grid is exported to a separate Excel sheet.

> **Important**
>
> This project requires UI for ASP.NET MVC version 2014.3.1125 and later. Earlier versions do not have the `ExcelExport` event exposed through the fluent API.
