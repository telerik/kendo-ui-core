# Export Multiple Grids to Excel

To see the example on how to export multiple Kendo UI Grids to the same Excel document, refer to [this Visual Studio project](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/miltiple-grid-excel). As a result, each Grid is exported to a separate Excel sheet.

> **Important**
>
> This project requires UI for ASP.NET MVC version 2014.3.1125 and later. Earlier versions do not have the `ExcelExport` event exposed through the fluent API.

For more information on how to create Excel documents, refer to [this article]({% slug introduction_excelexport_kendoui %}#create-excel-document).
