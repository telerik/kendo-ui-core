# Configure Ajax Editing with Localized Enumerations

To see the example on how to create a column bound to an `enum` field displaying localized texts for corresponding values, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/grid-enum-editing-with-dropdownlist-enum-localization). It also demonstrates how to edit this column using a DropDownList.
