# Kendo UI Music Store Overview

This article is an overview of the Kendo UI Music Store sample project. The Kendo UI Music Store includes two projects: a web application and a dashboard.

## The Web Application

This sample project is based on the [MVC Music Store from Microsoft](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/), so much of the server-side processing and the data structure are reused in this project.

The UI of the Music Store, however, is completely redesigned with Kendo UI. It focuses on [Kendo UI Professional](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui), the way it is used and interacts with ASP.NET MVC, WebAPI, and WCF Data Services.

The Dashboard builds upon the music store theme, adding a conceptual management dashboard to track the album performance. It focuses on [Kendo UI widgets rendering data vizualization](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) and the way Kendo UI and Sammy.js are used to create a visually rich single-page application.
