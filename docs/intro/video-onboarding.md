# Video Onboarding

Kendo UI for jQuery has two dedicated video getting started courses: one for [jQuery with JavaScript](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/30/kendo-ui-for-jquery-with-javascript) and another one for [jQuery with TypeScript](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/22/kendo-ui-for-jquery-with-typescript). These courses are available to both developers with active trial licenses and active commercial licenses in [Virtual Classroom](https://learn.telerik.com/learn). The training courses are developed to help you get started with the Kendo UI for jQuery components and features. They aim to put you in the shoes of an engineer who adds new features to an existing application.

The learning process starts by adding basic Kendo UI components and components to the application and shows how to harness the power of Kendo UI products in no time. Further on, you'll get into more advanced components, like the Chart and the Grid and learn how to incorporate Kendo UI components to interact with existing functionality and with each other. Finally, the courses explore how to build your own theme and change it for all components at once.

## Course Overview

The next two videos share a glimpse of the format and structure of the whole training and provide a brief overview of what will be accomplished through the steps. The first video covers the JavaScript course and the second&mdash;the TypeScript course.
