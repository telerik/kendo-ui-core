# Only What You Need

## Combined Scripts

To facilitate the common project types, the following combined scripts are available in the bundles or on CDN:

*  The `kendo.ui.core.min.js` contains all widgets supported by the [Kendo UI Core distribution]({% slug bundle_supportfor_kendoui_components %}). The relevant script is available in the Kendo UI Core package as well.
*  The `kendo.all.min.js` contains a minified version of all features provided by Kendo UI.

> **Important**
>
> The `kendo.all.min.js` is available in the Kendo UI Professional, Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC, Telerik UI for JSP and Telerik UI for PHP bundles. However, the `kendo.all.min.js` does not include the `kendo.aspnetmvc.min.js`. To install it, add `kendo.aspnetmvc.min.js` to `kendo.all.min.js`, or use the [custom download builder tool](http://www.telerik.com/download/custom-download).

* The `kendo.web.min.js` is available in Kendo UI Professional, JSP, PHP, and MVC. It includes the core framework and all desktop browser widgets (previously distributed as Kendo UI Web).
* The `kendo.dataviz.min.js` is available in Kendo UI Professional, JSP, PHP, and MVC. It includes the core framework and all data visualization widgets (previously distributed as Kendo UI DataViz).
* The `kendo.mobile.min.js` is available in Kendo UI Professional, JSP, PHP, and MVC. It includes the core framework and all mobile device specific widgets (previously distributed as Kendo UI Mobile).

> **Important**
>
> Only one of the combined JavaScript files can be included at a time, because they include the Kendo UI framework. To simultaneously use widgets from different Kendo UI suites, use the `kendo.all.min.js` or build a custom script.

In addition, none of the combined script files should be registered together with an individual widget script from the same suite. For example, `kendo.grid.js` should not be registered together with `kendo.web.js` or `kendo.all.js` because they already include the Grid scripts.

> **Important**
>
> Registering duplicate scripts might cause JavaScript errors and unexpected behavior.

## Individual Widget Scripts

Below are listed the references to the script files which, whether minified or not, can be included on a per-widget basis depending on the flavor you want to add to your project.

## Build Scripts

### Employ Download Builder

Users with a commercial license might use the [custom download builder tool](http://www.telerik.com/download/custom-download) to create a single JavaScript file which contains only the required widgets and features.

> **Important**
>
> Do not use multiple custom combined scripts, as they will contain duplicate code. Instead, create one combined script file, which includes everything you need.

### Use Gulp

If you use the Kendo UI Core package, you can build a custom distribution using the `gulp` build tool by following the instructions in the [README article](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core#building-only-what-you-need).

As of the Kendo UI 2014 Q3 release, the necessary build scripts are shipped in the `src/` directory of the downloadable commercial bundles. To build a custom distribution from the shipped source, run the shell commands from the example below.

###### Example

```sh
    cd src
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install
    gulp custom -c autocomplete,dropdownlist
```

List the components you want to be included in the custom build and separate them with a comma (`,`). The example above builds a custom minified script which includes the AutoComplete and the DropDownList widgets.

> **Important**
>
> When complete, the `gulp` command outputs a `kendo.custom.min.js` file in the `src/dist` directory. The Gulp build task automatically resolves the needed dependencies for each component, so you do not have to list them. Do not use multiple custom combined scripts, as they will contain duplicate code. Instead, create one combined script file, which includes everything you need.
