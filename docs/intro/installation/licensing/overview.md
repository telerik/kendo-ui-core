# Licensing Overview

Activating your Kendo UI for jQuery license in your project is a straightforward process that ensures the uninterrupted operation of the components and full access to their features. This guide walks you through the steps to properly integrate and activate your license key.

You can activate the Kendo UI for jQuery license in either of the following ways:

1. [Using the script license key](#using-the-script-license-key).

2. [Setting up your license key with NPM](#setting-up-your-license-key-with-npm).

## Using the Script License Key

 In this method, you include a JavaScript license file provided by Kendo UI directly in your project. This script contains the license key and needs to be referenced in your HTML or JavaScript file.

 This approach is typically used when youâ€™re integrating Kendo UI through a [CDN (Content Delivery Network)]({% slug kendoui_cdn_services_installation %}) or if you are using the Kendo UI version that is directly downloaded as a ZIP file and added to your project.

## Setting Up Your License Key With NPM

When using NPM, the Kendo UI package is installed via the npm registry and integrated into your project through package management tools like `npm` or `yarn`. The license key is typically set within the `package.json` or a separate configuration file.

This approach is ideal for modern web development workflows, especially when working with bundlers like Webpack, and projects built using frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js.
