1. Navigate to the [**Downloads** section](https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads) of your account.
1. Search for **Progress® Kendo UI® for jQuery** and download the package.

## Included Assemblies 

When the download completes, each folder inside the downloaded archive contains the following folders:

|Folders 						|Contents |
