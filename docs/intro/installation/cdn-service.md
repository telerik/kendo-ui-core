# Use Kendo UI CDN Services

The Kendo UI CDN is hosted on [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). In order to access the Kendo UI CDN Service, you can use either of the options described below.

## Option 1: Via the HTTP Protocol

The minified versions of all JavaScript files are available via the following URLs:  
`https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/VERSION/js/FILENAME.min.js`
`https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/VERSION/styles/FILENAME.min.css`

For example, the 2014.1.318 version can be loaded from:  
<https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.318/js/kendo.all.min.js>  
<https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.318/styles/kendo.common.min.css>

Use the following URL to load the minified Kendo UI Core script (available since Q1 2014 SP1):
<https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.416/js/kendo.ui.core.min.js>

> **Important**  
> The <http://cdn.kendostatic.com/> URL will remain active, but is no longer recommended for new projects.

## Option 2: Via the HTTPS Protocol

To access the Kendo UI CDN service through the HTTPS protocol, use the same host name as above, only replacing the scheme (protocol) with `https`:  
<https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.318/js/kendo.all.min.js>

> **Important**  
> The <https://da7xgjtj801h2.cloudfront.net/> URL will remain active, but is no longer recommended for new projects.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue 1:** Disruption and connection problems
Although the Amazon CloudFront service provides for a reliable level of uptime support, you may encounter disruption or connection troubles. After you have checked the status of the systems at [http://status.aws.amazon.com/](http://status.aws.amazon.com/), the CDN status is reported as healthy and is operating normally.

**Cause:** You could be experiencing Internet or network connectivity problems, or DNS problems, or it is possible that firewalls, antivirus or other security software incorrectly filters out the CDN scripts or modifies (breaks) them on-the-fly.

**Fix:** Contact your system administrator, as remote investigation of connection problems is outside the scope of Kendo UI support.

**Issue 2:** How to refer Kendo UI From CDN With a Local Script Fallback

**Cause:** Kendo UI internal builds are not uploaded on CDN, because they are intended only for clients with a commercial license. Only major releases and service packs are uploaded on the Kendo UI CDN.

**Fix:** You should use a private CDN for internal builds. It is recommendable to implement a local fallback when using any kind of CDN in the way displayed here:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to Kendo UI</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.318/styles/kendo.common.min.css" />

        <script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.318/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            if (typeof jQuery == "undefined") {
                // fallback to local jQuery
                document.write(decodeURIComponent('%3Cscript src="/path/to/local/jquery.min.js" %3E%3C/script%3E'));
            }
        </script>

        <script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.1.318/js/kendo.all.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            if (typeof kendo == "undefined") {
                // checking for loaded CSS files is cumbersome,
                // that's why we assume that if the scripts have failed, so have the stylesheets

                // fallback to local Kendo UI stylesheets
                document.write(decodeURIComponent('%3Clink rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/local/kendo.common.min.css" %3C/%3E'));
                document.write(decodeURIComponent('%3Clink rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/local/kendo.blueopal.min.css" %3C/%3E'));

                // fallback to local Kendo UI scripts
                document.write(decodeURIComponent('%3Cscript src="/path/to/local/kendo.all.min.js" %3E%3C/script%3E'));
                // also add kendo.aspnetmvc.min.js or kendo.timezones.min.js, if needed
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello world!
