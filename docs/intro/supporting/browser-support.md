# Web Browser and Operating System Support

## Web Browser Support

Kendo UI components are designed to support all major browsers and to operate without the worries of cross-browser compatibility, standards compliance or touch-device support. However, depending on the specifics of your project and the components you prefer to use, the browser support provided by Kendo UI widgets may vary between the versions.

### Web Browser Support General

Most [Kendo UI widgets](/intro/supporting/list-of-widgets) have no limitations as of the browser versions they support.

| Browser           | Supported Versions            | Limitations
| :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------
| Internet Explorer | 8 or later                    | Kendo UI [Spreadsheet](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/spreadsheet/index) and [Responsive panel](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/responsive-panel/index) require IE9 or later
| Chrome            | 21 or later                   |
| Firefox           | [Current and ESR releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Firefox#Release_history) ([What is ESR?](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/))|
| Opera             | 15 or later                   |
| OS X Safari       | [6.2.6 or later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history#Mac)|

### Web Browser Support for Hybrid UI

The [hybrid UI widgets and frameworks](/intro/supporting/list-of-widgets) are intended for Cordova based deployments, and support the following mobile device browsers and their corresponding web view components:

| Browser           | Supported Versions            |

#### Browsers with limited support

| Browser           | Supported Versions            | Limitations                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :-----------                              |
| Internet Explorer | 8                             | PDF and image export is not supported     |
|                   |                               | Text rotation is not supported by the 64-bit versions |

|                   |                               | Android 2.x, therefore, uses non-interactive canvas output |
|Android            | 2.3                           | The Canvas rendering mode is only supported

### Important Notes

* As of Kendo UI 2015 Q3 release Internet Explorer 7 is no longer supported.

* Since Internet Explorer 11 was released in October 2013, look up the Q3 2013 SP2 (2013.3.1324) or a more recent Kendo UI version if you need support for it

* Browsers in beta stage are not supported
* Exporting a zoomed in/out page to PDF is not supported.
* [Quirks mode](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html) is not supported
> **Important**  
> Always specify a [DOCTYPE](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/doctypes/). Recommended doctypes include `HTML5`, `XHTML 1.1`, `XHTML 1.0 Strict` and `HTML4 Strict`. The `HTML4 Transitional` DOCTYPE fires the Quirks mode and should not be used. `XHTML 1.0 Transitional` works well in most cases, but may cause issues with the vertical positioning of icons. The correct syntax for [all doctypes](http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html) is provided on the [W3C website](http://www.w3.org/).

* Internet Explorer compatibility modes are not supported. These modes can exhibit different behavior and rendering bugs as compared to the browser versions they emulate.
* Windows Universal apps and Cordova for Windows environments are not supported, due to the [sandbox restrictions of the environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh849625.aspx#Automatic_script_filtering). The recommended UI suite for this environment is [UI for Windows Universal](http://www.telerik.com/windows-universal-ui).
* It is highly advisable to use [Internet Explorer Edge mode](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/16/ie-s-compatibility-features-for-site-developers.aspx) via a META tag or an HTTP header:

```
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
```

* Kendo UI uses a progressive enhancement for its CSS styling. As a result, old and obsolete browsers may ignore CSS 3 styles such as rounded corners and linear gradients.

* Internet Explorer behaves differently when embedded inside a desktop (WinForms) application. It reports to support pointer events, but actually doesn't. As a result, some events, on which Kendo UI relies, are not fired. In order to avoid this problem, the following JavaScript code must be executed before the Kendo UI scripts are registered:

```
<script>
    window.MSPointerEvent = null;
    window.PointerEvent = null;
</script>
```

## Operating System Support

### Important Notes

* Hybrid mouse and touch-screen devices are supported; for example, Internet Explorer 10, Chrome and Firefox on Windows 8
* JavaScript should be enabled on all browsers so that they can be allowed to run scripts

## Best Performance

To ensure the best performance of your project, make sure that you:

 * Always use an up-to-date browser version
 * Check **Disable Script Debugging** from your browser configuration options
 * Activate Caching in Internet Explorer
