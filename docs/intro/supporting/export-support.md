# Export Support

Kendo UI for jQuery integrates the Pako and JSZip libraries to support the content export of its controls to PDF and Excel.

## Pako Library

The [Pako Deflate library](https://nodeca.github.io/pako/#Deflate) enables the compression of the files that will be exported to PDF. To enable the PDF export, you need to load Pako in the specified page.

    <!-- Load Pako Deflate library to enable PDF compression -->
    <script src="https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/{{ site.cdnVersion }}/js/pako_deflate.min.js"></script>

For more information on the available PDF export options by Kendo UI, refer to the articles on [PDF Export]({% slug introduction_pdfexport_kendoui %}) and [PDF output by the Drawing library]({% slug pdfderawingexport_drawingapi %}).

## JSZip Library

The [JSZip library](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) is necessary for the components to support Excel export and for the Spreadsheet to support the import of Excel files. The Excel export feature is available as of the [Kendo UI 2014.3.1119 (Q3 2014) release]({% slug breakingchanges2014_kendoui%}) and you need to include the JSZip library only if you have to provide export to Excel or to import the [`fromFile()`](/api/javascript/ui/spreadsheet/methods/fromfile) functionalities.

For more information on the available Excel export options by Kendo UI, refer to the section on [Excel export]({% slug introduction_excelexport_kendoui %}).
