# kendo.ui.Window

Represents the Kendo UI Window. Inherits from [Widget](/api/javascript/ui/widget).

## Configuration

### actions `Array` *(default: ["Close"])*

The buttons for interacting with the Window.

The predefined array values are:

* `Close`
* `Refresh`
* `Minimize`
* `Maximize`
* `Pin`


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and customize which header buttons like close, refresh, minimize, maximize, or pin appear in the window’s title bar by specifying a set of interactive commands or actions. Enable, configure, or set the visible top bar controls to tailor window behavior with options for closing, updating content, minimizing the window, maximizing screen space, or pinning it in place. Adjust the displayed toolbar buttons to match desired user interface interactions, allowing developers to choose exactly which window controls are accessible and how they function within the window component’s header area.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      actions: [ "Minimize", "Maximize" ]
    });
    </script>

### animation `Boolean|Object`

A collection of `{Animation}` objects that is used to change the default animations. When set to `false`, all animations will be disabled.

> `animation:true` is not a valid configuration.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure, customize, or disable window transitions and visual effects for opening, closing, and other state changes by applying a set of animation objects or completely turning off animations; control how window animations behave, override default effects, set custom transition sequences, enable or disable animated effects, and manage window motion behaviors to tailor user interface responsiveness and visual flow without using invalid configurations.
</div>

#### Example - disabling the animation

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: false
    });
    </script>

### animation.close `Object`

The animation that will be used when a Window closes.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and customize how windows animate during closing sequences by setting parameters such as animation type, effect style, transition duration, and easing curves; enable smooth visual effects for closing windows, adjust timing for faster or slower closures, disable animations for instant window shutdowns, or fine-tune the closing animation behavior for better user experience and interface responsiveness.
</div>

#### Example - disabling the closing animation

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: {
        close: false
      }
    });
    </script>

### animation.close.effects `String`

The effect that will be used when the popup closes.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure and customize the closing animation for popups or window components by selecting or setting different transition effects like fade out, slide away, zoom out, or other exit animations to control how the interface element smoothly disappears or exits the viewport, enabling developers to enhance user interface responsiveness and visual feedback during close interactions, exit sequences, or window dismissal with fluid animated effects.
</div>

#### Example - using only the fade-out animation when closing the Window

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: {
        close: {
          effects: "fade:out"
        }
      }
    });
    </script>

### animation.close.duration `Number`

Defines the duration of the closing animation.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Adjust, configure, or control the length of the closing animation for a window or user interface element by setting the duration in milliseconds, enabling customization of the speed and timing of window close transitions to create smooth, faster, or slower UI effects. Modify the close animation timing to optimize user experience by fine-tuning how quickly or gradually the window disappearance effect runs, using numeric values to set precise animation intervals, allowing developers to enhance interface responsiveness and visual flow during window closures, including reducing delay or extending animation length for design consistency or performance preferences.
</div>

#### Example - making the closing animation two seconds long

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: {
        close: {
          duration: 2000
        }
      }
    });
    </script>

### animation.open `Object`

The animation that will be used when a Window opens.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure and customize the opening animation behavior of a window or dialog, including setting the entrance effect, transition duration, easing curve, fade-in, slide, zoom, or bounce animations, and controlling how the window visually appears when triggered to open, enabling smooth, configurable, and animated window display with adjustable timing and visual style effects for enhanced user interfaces and UX transitions.
</div>

#### Example - disabling the opening animation

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: {
        open: false
      },
      visible: false
    });
    $("#dialog").data("kendoWindow").open();
    </script>

### animation.open.effects `String`

The effect that will be used when the popup opens.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure and customize the opening animation effects for popup windows, enabling control over how the window visually appears with options like fade-in, slide-in, zoom, or other entrance animations. Adjust or set the animation style, effect type, or transition when a window or popup opens to create smooth, dynamic, or attention-grabbing entrance sequences. Enable, define, or control entry animations for UI components that appear on-screen, specifying different visual transition effects for popups or windows as they become visible.
</div>

#### Example - using only the fade animation when opening the Window

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: {
        open: {
          effects: "fade:in"
        }
      },
      visible: false
    });
    $("#dialog").data("kendoWindow").open();
    </script>

### animation.open.duration `Number`

Defines the duration of the opening animation.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and configure the length of the opening animation for windows, adjusting how long the show or appear animation runs when a window opens, enabling customization of effects like fade-in, slide-in, or other transition styles. This setting impacts the speed, timing, and smoothness of window launch animations, allowing developers to fine-tune the perceived responsiveness and visual flow of UI elements by setting duration values for the open or reveal animations. Adjust the open animation timing to enhance user experience with customizable entry effects for windows and dialogs, managing the speed of appearance transitions and animation lengths for opening interface components.
</div>

#### Example - making the opening animation 100 milliseconds long

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      animation: {
        open: {
          duration: 100
        }
      },
      visible: false
    });
    $("#dialog").data("kendoWindow").open();
    </script>

### appendTo `Object|String` *(default: document.body)*

The element to which the Window will be appended. It is beneficial to [use the Window together with a form](/web/window/overview#using-kendo-ui-window-with-a-form) which does not constrain the dragging of the Window within the specific element. For such scenarios, use the [`draggable.containment`](/api/javascript/ui/window/configuration/draggable.containment) setting.

> Appending the Window to an element styled with `overflow:hidden`, `overflow:auto`, or `overflow:scroll` may result in undesired behavior because the Window will not be displayed outside the  boundaries of the element. Unwanted scrollbars may appear as well.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control where the window or popup is added in the DOM by selecting a specific container element to manage its rendering context, z-index stacking, and visibility boundaries. Set or configure the target element to append modals, dialogs, or floating windows within certain parts of the page, ensuring proper containment and avoiding clipping issues caused by CSS overflow settings like hidden, auto, or scroll. Enable or disable dragging constraints relative to this container to prevent unwanted movement restrictions or scrollbars, adjusting the parent node to influence layering order and scroll behavior for dynamic overlays, forms, or popup interfaces.
</div>

#### Example - setting the Window container to be with the id="mainForm" form

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      appendTo: "form#mainForm"
    });
    </script>

### autoFocus `Boolean` *(default: true)*

Determines whether the Window will be focused automatically when opened. The property also influences the focus behavior when an already opened Window is clicked.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure automatic focus behavior for window interfaces to ensure that a window gains keyboard focus immediately upon opening or when users click on it, enhancing accessibility, keyboard navigation, and user interaction flow. Enable or disable auto-focus settings to control focus management dynamically, supporting scenarios where managing focus on modal or popup windows is critical for usability, tab order control, and screen reader compatibility. This focus control facilitates seamless user experience by allowing windows to receive input focus as soon as they appear or when reactivated by user clicks, improving interaction efficiency and accessibility compliance.
</div>

#### Example - setting the autoFocus property

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      autoFocus: false
    });
    </script>

### content `Object|String`

Specifies a URL or request options from where the Window will load its content.

> For URLs which start with a protocol (for example, http://), a container `iframe` element is automatically created. As this behavior may change in future versions, try to always use the [iframe configuration option](#iframe).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Load or fetch web content dynamically by specifying a URL or detailed HTTP request options such as method, headers, and payload to inject HTML or external resources into a window or container. Enable remote content rendering through AJAX or direct URL loading, with automatic iframe embedding for protocol-based addresses, supporting configuration of request parameters, content sourcing, dynamic HTML injection, asynchronous HTTP requests, embedded browsing contexts, cross-domain content loading, and customizable data fetching settings for displaying external pages or data within application windows or UI components.
</div>

#### Example - fetching content from the server

```
  <base href="https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/window/ajax">
```


### content.url `String`

Specifies the url from which the content is fetched


<div class="meta-api-description">
Specify or configure the URL for loading remote HTML content into a window or panel, enabling dynamic fetching of web pages, fragments, or endpoints via HTTP requests or AJAX calls with support for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). This setting controls from where the window fetches and renders external HTML content, allowing developers to set, update, or bind the source URL for embedded web views, remote templates, or live content loading within user interfaces. It supports scenarios like injecting external web pages, loading remote fragments, or pulling content asynchronously from APIs, servers, or other web resources into the component.
</div>

#### Example - fetching JSON and displaying it through a template

    <base href="https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/window/ajax" />
    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
      $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
        content: {
          url: "../content/web/tabstrip/ajax/ajaxContent2.html",
        },
      });
    </script>

### content.dataType `String` *(default: "html")*

The type of result expected from the remote service. Used values are "html" and "json".


<div class="meta-api-description">
Specify or configure the expected format of remote content loading and parsing for a window or frame, controlling whether the incoming response is handled and interpreted as HTML markup or JSON data; useful for setting response types, managing content rendering, handling AJAX or API responses, enabling dynamic content loading with proper data interpretation, and adjusting parsing behavior based on the content format from external services or servers.
</div>

#### Example - fetching and displaying JSON content it in the Window

    <div id="dialog"></div>

    <script>
      $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
        content: {
          url: "https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/shared/js/products.js",
          dataType: "json"
        }
      });
    </script>

### content.iframe `Boolean`

If the URL for the Window content contains a protocol, the Window creates an iframe for the content and assumes that the nested page resides in another domain.

If the URL does not contain a protocol, the URL is treated as a local URL which will load a partial view and the Window does not create an iframe for the content.

To control the creation of iframe Window content, you have to explicitly configure the option.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure how content loads within a window by controlling iframe creation to embed remote URLs or load local partial views directly; enable or disable iframe usage based on whether the target URL includes protocols like http or https, treating absolute links as cross-domain content loaded inside an iframe and relative or local paths as inline content without frames, with options to explicitly set or override automatic iframe behavior for dynamic page embedding, cross-origin content display, secure remote loading, partial view rendering, and flexible content source management.
</div>

#### Example - Explicitly configure an iframe

    <div id="dialog"></div>

    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      content: {
        url: "https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/shared/js/products.js",
        dataType: "json",
        iframe: true
      }
    });
    </script>

### content.template `String`

The template for the content of a Window. Returned data from the server will be given as the `data` of this template.

If the returned data is JSON, the [`dataType`](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) parameter has to be passed so that the data gets parsed by jQuery.

If the URL contains a protocol, set `iframe` to `false`. Otherwise, the JSON response will be injected in the content area of the Window as is.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control display of dynamic or remote content within a window by defining an inline or external template to render server responses, binding returned data as template variables for flexible data integration and presentation. Configure how JSON or other data formats are parsed and injected into the window content, including options to set content as raw HTML or safely parsed templates based on request URLs and protocols. Enable seamless templating with support for AJAX data parsing, JSON response handling, and conditional embedding of content using iframes or direct injection, allowing developers to customize window rendering by providing template markup, managing asynchronous data binding, and integrating server-side data into client-side views.
</div>

#### Example - fetching JSON and displaying it through a template

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      content: {
        url: "https://runner.telerik.io/fullscreen/tZWehimq.json",
        dataType: "json",
        iframe: false,
        template: ({ username }) => `User name: ${username}`
      }
    });
    </script>

### draggable `Object|Boolean` *(default: true)*

Enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the dragging of the widget.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control whether a window or UI component can be moved, repositioned, or dragged using mouse or touch input by enabling or disabling drag interaction, dragging functionality, or movable behavior; configure draggable states to allow users to click and drag elements like title bars or panels, set or toggle drag capability for repositioning interfaces, and manage user ability to drag windows or components across the screen for a customizable, interactive layout experience.
</div>

#### Example - disabling the dragging of the Window

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      draggable: false
    });
    </script>

#### Example - setting draggable object configuration

    <div id="container">
      <div id="dialog">
        <div style="width: 20px; height: 20px; border: 1px solid red;" id="handle"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      draggable: {
        containment: "#container",
        axis: "x",
        dragHandle: "#handle"
      }
    });
    </script>

### draggable.containment `String|Element|jQuery` *default: ""*

Defines the element in which the window will be able to move. The containment option overrides the [`appendTo`](/api/javascript/ui/window/configuration/draggable.containment) setting and attaches the Window to the specified DOM element. Accepts either a selector or an element.

> The containment element has to be positioned, that is, its CSS `position` attribute has to be set to `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and limit the draggable movement or dragging boundaries of a window or popup within a specific container element or DOM boundary by setting a containment target, enabling confinement inside a particular area or layout region to prevent dragging outside a parent, ancestor, or designated selector; configure containment using CSS positioned elements (relative, absolute, or fixed) as the bounding box, accepting selectors or direct element references to restrict, constrain, or clamp drag interactions to a defined zone within the webpage or app interface.
</div>

#### Example

    <style>
        #container {
          position: relative;
          width: 500px;
          height: 500px;
          border: 1px solid grey;
        }
    </style>

    <div id="container">
        <div id="window">
            <p>Alvar Aalto is one of the greatest names in modern architecture and design.
              Glassblowers at the iittala factory still meticulously handcraft the legendary vases
              that are variations on one theme, fluid organic shapes that let the end user decide the use.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
          $("#window").kendoWindow({
            width: "300px",
            height: "200px",
            draggable: {
                containment: "#container"
            }
          });
        });
    </script>

### draggable.axis `String` *default: ""*

Constrains dragging to the horizontal (x) or to the vertical (y) axis.

The supported values are:

* `x`
* `y`


<div class="meta-api-description">
Limit or configure draggable window movement along a specific axis by enabling horizontal-only or vertical-only dragging controls, restricting dragging behavior to either side-to-side or up-and-down directions, setting movement constraints for window drag functionality, defining axis constraints during initialization to lock dragging to the x-axis (left-right) or y-axis (up-down), specifying directional drag limits for user interface windows, controlling and enabling drag gestures on a single axis, adjusting window drag behavior for UX purposes to constrain motion horizontally or vertically.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="container">
      <div id="dialog">
      </div>
    </div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      draggable: {
        axis: "x"
      }
    });
    </script>

### draggable.dragHandle `String` *default: ".k-window-titlebar"*

Restricts the dragging of the window through the specified element which will be part of the window content. Accepts either a selector or an element.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and configure dragging behavior within a window or container by specifying a particular element or selector that acts as the exclusive drag handle, enabling drag operations only when interacting with that designated area such as a title bar, header, or custom handle inside the component. Enable or restrict drag initiation to a specific sub-element by setting a reference or CSS selector, so that drag gestures outside this handle are ignored, allowing precise customization of drag zones, user interaction control, and improved UX for movable UI panels or dialogs. Adjust drag regions, activate drag on a specific part of the window, lock drag start to chosen elements, or configure drag boundaries within the child elements for refined drag-and-drop behavior and interface control.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog">
      <div style="width: 20px; height: 20px; border: 1px solid red;" id="handle"></div>
    </div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      draggable: {
        dragHandle: "#handle"
      }
    });
    </script>

### iframe `Boolean`

Explicitly states whether a content `iframe` will be created. For more information, refer to the documentation on [using `iframes`](/controls/window/content).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control the option to create or prevent a dedicated embedded frame within the main window for loading external HTML content, isolating component DOM elements, applying separate styles, or securely displaying remote web pages; adjust settings to enable or disable using nested browsing contexts, frame elements, or content isolation methods that affect how external resources or isolated components render within the application environment.
</div>

#### Example - loading the full page

```pseudo
    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      content: "https://www.telerik.com/",
      iframe: true
    });
    </script>
```

### height `Number | String`

Specifies the height of the Window.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control, configure, or set the vertical size, visible height, or pixel height of a window or UI container dynamically during initialization or runtime using numeric values or CSS-compatible strings like pixels, percentages, or viewport units. Adjust, resize, or modify the height dimension to influence layout, scaling, responsiveness, or visible space of window components or panels, with support for runtime updates and style-based sizing options for flexible interface design and pixel-perfect or relative height adjustments.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      height: 400
    });
    </script>

#### Example - specifying the height of the Window in percent

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      height: "50%"
    });
    </script>

### maxHeight `Number` *(default: Infinity)*

The maximum height (in pixels) that may be achieved by resizing the Window.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set or configure the upper limit for vertical resizing on window or UI components to prevent exceeding a specific maximum height in pixels, enabling control over window dimension constraints, bounding how tall the resizable container or dialog can grow, restricting the height during user drag or programmatic resizing, enforcing size limits on windows, frames, or panels, and managing maximum allowable vertical size for layout consistency and responsive design.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      maxHeight: 300
    });
    </script>

### maxWidth `Number` *(default: Infinity)*

The maximum width (in pixels) that may be achieved by resizing the Window.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure or set a maximum width limit to constrain how wide a window or resizable component can expand, controlling or restricting its horizontal resize boundaries in pixels to prevent it from growing beyond a specified width; enable max size restrictions during initialization or dynamically define the upper limit for resizing, ensuring the interface stays within desired screen or layout constraints while allowing flexible or unlimited width if no maximum is set.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      maxWidth: 300
    });
    </script>

### minHeight `Number` *(default: 50)*

The minimum height (in pixels) that may be achieved by resizing the Window.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set or configure the minimum height limit to restrict resizing of a window or interface element so it cannot shrink below a defined pixel value, enabling control over the smallest allowable vertical dimension during manual dragging or programmatic resizing, ensuring layouts maintain usability and visibility by enforcing height constraints and preventing collapse or overly small display areas in applications.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      minHeight: 100
    });
    </script>

### minWidth `Number` *(default: 50)*

The minimum width (in pixels) that may be achieved by resizing the Window.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and restrict the smallest width dimension in pixels that a window, panel, or interface component can be resized to, ensuring the layout does not become too narrow or collapse when users drag or adjust window edges. Configure minimum width limits for resizable UI elements to maintain usability, prevent content clipping, or enforce design constraints by setting pixel-based boundaries that stop resizing below a defined threshold. Enable, set, or adjust the least allowed horizontal size to guarantee consistent display behavior, protect interface integrity, and optimize layout responsiveness across different window sizes or screen setups.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      minWidth: 100
    });
    </script>

### modal `Boolean|Object` *(default: false)*

Specifies whether the Window will display a modal overlay over the page.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control whether a window displays a blocking overlay that disables interaction with page elements behind it, enabling or disabling modal dialogs that prevent clicks and input on the background content; configure modal behavior to show a backdrop that locks user focus inside the window or make the window modeless to allow users to interact freely with underlying page elements, toggling between modal and non-blocking window states for managing user attention, focus trapping, and overlay visibility during dialogs, popups, or temporary forms.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      modal: true
    });
    </script>

### modal.preventScroll `Boolean` *(default: false)*

Specifies whether the document will stop scrolling when a modal dialog is opened. Closing the modal dialog has to restore the initial document overflow. The `modal.preventScroll` setting will modify the overflow rule of the document and, therefore, cannot be used together with the [`containment`](/api/javascript/ui/window/configuration/draggable.containment) option.

> Multiple windows with different `preventScroll` settings are not supported.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control blocking or disabling page scroll behind an open modal dialog by configuring overflow prevention on the main document or window when popups, dialogs, or overlay windows are active to keep background content fixed and prevent user scrolling interactions; manage the restoration of scroll behavior when modals close, avoid conflicts with containment boundaries, and understand that multiple open modals with differing scroll lock settings may not function simultaneously.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoDialog({
      modal: {
          preventScroll: true
      }
    });
    </script>

### pinned `Boolean` *(default: false)*

Specifies whether the Window will be pinned, that is, that it will not move together with the page content during scrolling.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control whether a window or panel remains fixed in place onscreen regardless of page scrolling, enabling pinning or locking the window’s position so it stays visible while other content scrolls underneath; configure the window to stay anchored, prevent movement during scroll, enable fixed positioning or toggle between pinned and scrollable states, ideal for keeping important UI elements, toolbars, or dialogs always accessible as users navigate the page or interact with dynamic content.
</div>

#### Example

    <div style="height: 5000px;"></div>
    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      pinned: true,
      position: { top: 100 }
    });
    </script>

### position `Object`

A collection of one or two members which define the initial top and/or left position of the Window or the position of the [`containment` element](/api/javascript/ui/window/configuration/draggable.containment) on the page.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and configure the starting location or coordinates for windows, dialogs, or containers on a webpage by specifying horizontal and vertical placement values such as top, left, initial position, or offset. Enable setting or adjusting where a window appears within the viewport or relative containment boundaries, including precise pixel positioning, layout anchoring, or alignment preferences to determine the window’s starting point. Tailor interface positioning with options to define the left and top coordinates, control window placement on page load, and manage containment element alignments for user interface elements or overlays.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      position: {
        top: 100, // or "100px"
        left: "20%"
      }
    });
    </script>

### position.top `Number|String`

Specifies the initial top position of the Window. Numeric values are treated as pixels. String values can specify pixels, percentages, ems, or other valid values.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control vertical placement and initial offset of a window by specifying its top position using numeric pixel values or string formats including pixels, percentages, em units, and other CSS units. Adjust, configure, or set the top margin, top offset, vertical alignment, or custom layout starting point for windows on screen load, allowing precise vertical positioning, centering by percentage, or relative sizing to viewport or container dimensions. Enable fine-tuning of window top edge placement for UI design, dynamic layouts, modal dialogs, or any scenario requiring customized vertical start positions at launch or initialization.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="window"></div>
    <script>

    <script>
    $("#window").kendoWindow({
      size: "wide"
    });
    </script>

## Methods

### center

Centers the Window within the viewport.

If the Window has no set dimensions and is centered before its content is loaded with Ajax, it might resize after the content is loaded. This will change the position of the widget on the screen and it will no longer be centered. If you need to center the Window, then either center it in its [`refresh`](/api/javascript/ui/window/events/refresh) event or set [explicit dimensions](/api/javascript/ui/window#configuration-height).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Reposition and align a window or dialog box at the center of the viewport or screen, enabling developers to recenter UI components after opening, dynamic content loads, or layout adjustments, ensuring consistent on-screen positioning and handling resizing scenarios by controlling centering behavior post-render or after Ajax content updates, useful for setting or maintaining the window’s visual focus, resetting coordinates, and managing responsive or dynamic interfaces.
</div>

#### Returns

`kendo.ui.Window` - Returns the Window object to support chaining. For example, center and open the Window with a single expression.

#### Example

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow();
    var dialog = $("#dialog").data("kendoWindow");
    dialog.center();
    // chaining example
    // dialog.center().open();
    </script>

### close

Closes the Window.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Programmatically shut, dismiss, hide, or close an open window or dialog via a method call to terminate or cancel workflows, respond to user actions or external events, remove the window from view, and trigger standard closing operations on the window or component instance after initialization, enabling developers to control UI visibility, manage modal states, dismiss popups, or implement custom window closing logic in applications.
</div>

#### Returns

`kendo.ui.Window` - Returns the Window object to support chaining.

#### Example - closing a Window after one second

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow();
    var dialog = $("#dialog").data("kendoWindow");
    setTimeout(function() {
      dialog.close();
    }, 1000);
    </script>

### content

Gets or sets the content of a Window. When used as a setter, supports chaining.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Retrieve or update the displayed content inside a window or panel dynamically during runtime by getting or setting the current inner content, enabling programmatic control to fetch existing content, replace it with new elements or text, modify what is shown on screen, refresh or change UI views, and chain methods to manage content updates efficiently within windowed interface components.
</div>

#### Parameters

##### content `String|jQuery` *(optional)*

The content of the Window. Can be an HTML string or a jQuery object.

#### Returns

`String` - If used a getter, the current content of the Window. If used as a setter, the method returns the Window object to support chaining.

#### Example - getting the content of the Window

    <div id="dialog">foo</div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow();

    dialog.open();
    </script>

### pin

Pins the Window to its current position with a `position:fixed` style, that is, the widget stops moving together with the other page content when the page is scrolled. The user will still be able to move the Window with the mouse or through the keyboard.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure the interface element to remain fixed and visible on the screen regardless of page scrolling, enabling developers to lock the component’s position using methods that apply fixed positioning in CSS while preserving its current coordinates. This feature supports scenarios where the window or panel must stay static and accessible during scroll events, and it also maintains user interactivity through dragging or keyboard navigation without shifting with other content. Enable, set, or control persistent overlay behavior for UI components to keep them pinned, anchored, or locked to the viewport during dynamic page movement, ensuring stable display even as users scroll or navigate.
</div>

#### Example

    <div style="height: 5000px;"></div>
    <div id="dialog"></div>

## Events

### activate

Triggered when a Window has finished its opening animation.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Respond to the moment when a window or modal fully opens, including after any opening animations or transitions, to execute actions like setting focus on input fields, initiating data fetching, triggering interface updates, running code after the window becomes active and interactive, controlling behavior once the window is fully displayed, and handling events that indicate the UI is ready for user interaction or further processing immediately after opening.
</div>

#### Example - subscribe to the "activate" event during initialization

    <div id="dialog"></div>
    <script>
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow({
      activate: function() {
        // the opening animation has finished

    }
    $("#dialog").kendoWindow();
    var dialog = $("#dialog").data("kendoWindow");
    dialog.bind("activate", window_activate);
    </script>

### close

Triggered when a Window is closed either by the user or through the `close()` method.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Detect or listen for window closure events triggered by user action or programmatic commands to perform cleanup tasks, save application state, update interfaces, synchronize components, execute teardown routines, manage resource disposal, handle closing events, run finalization code, or trigger data persistence when the window is closing or closed.
</div>

#### Event Data

##### e.userTriggered `Boolean`

Indicates whether the close action was triggered by the user either by clicking the **Close** button or by pressing `Esc`. When the `close` method was called, this field is `false`.

    </script>

### deactivate

Triggered when a Window has finished its closing animation.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Detect when a window or modal has fully finished closing or hiding animations to run cleanup tasks, remove elements from the DOM, detach event listeners or handlers, reset focus to previous elements, update UI or application states, trigger subsequent navigation, or launch new windows and dialogs only after the visual close transition completes. Listen for the completion of close or hide animations to ensure actions happen precisely after the window is no longer visible or active, enabling controlled teardown, resource release, and state management when closing interfaces or dialogs have finished their exit effects.
</div>

#### Example - subscribing to the deactivate event during initialization

    <div id="dialog"></div>
