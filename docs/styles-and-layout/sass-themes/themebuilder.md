# ThemeBuilder Overview

The [ThemeBuilder is an online tool](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com) that enables you to create custom themes and instantly preview how the components will look. The tool generates a [CSS file that you can use in your Kendo UI app]({%slug sassbasedthemes_customization_kendoui%}#loading-custom-themes) instead of a built-in theme.

Visit the [ThemeBuilder documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder) to learn how to:

* [Create a custom theme](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/get-started/first-steps-theme-builder)
* Migrate custom themes to new component versions [automatically](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/web-app/automatic-migrations) or [manually](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/web-app/migrating-projects)
* [Export and use a theme in your Kendo UI app](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/exported-package)
