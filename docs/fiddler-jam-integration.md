# Using Kendo UI with Telerik Fiddler Jam

[Fiddler Jam](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-jam) is a Telerik tool designed to record network activity, and capture console logs and screenshots. 

A simple capture log from the end-user can provide the following information:

- Video recording and screenshots
- Console logs and errors
- Network capture
- Local and Session Storage logs
- User action events

## Installing the Extension

You can download and install the Fiddler Jam Chrome extension from the [Chrome Web Store page for Fiddler Jam](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fiddler-jam/fnkjlegmkbicdodlheligomlfbdblpfj). For detailed instructions on how to install the extension, refer to the [Fiddler Jam Extension installation article](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/extension/installation).
