# {{ site.product }} Accessibility Overview

Websites and applications are accessible when they provide full control over their features through assistive technologies or keyboard navigation and thus enable users with disabilities to access their content.

>tip For more information about accessibility, see the [Telerik and Kendo UI Design System documentation](https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/foundation/accessibility/global-accessibility/).

Kendo UI for jQuery enables accessibility by considering the following aspects:

* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)]({% slug section508_wcag21_accessibility_support %})
* [Section 508]({% slug section508_accessibility_support %})
* [WAI-ARIA]({% slug wai_aria_accessibility_support %})
* [Keyboard Navigation]({% slug keyboard_shortcuts_accessibility_support %})
* [Themes & Swatches]({% slug high_contrast_theme_accessibility_support %})

The Kendo UI for jQuery components are extensible and customizable. Depending on the level of customization applied, however, you can introduce rendering that is not accessible. Thus, we recommended web developers test any modifications and templates they create to ensure the components meet the desired level of accessibility standards. 

Refer to the Kendo UI for jQuery [accessibility demos](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/accessibility), where you can test the accessibility level and compliance of the UI components.
