## Environment

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Product</td>
  <td>Progress® Kendo UI® ListBox for jQuery</td>
 </tr>
</table>

 
## Description

My ListBoxes use a template to display their items. When I drag or move an item with the toolbar to the second ListBox, the item is moved but the data is not displayed.

How can I display the data of the ListBox item that was moved?

## Solution

The template is not automatically rebound after drag-and-drop and this issue is expected. To work around it, manually refresh the second ListBoxt on the [`dragend`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/listbox/events/dragend) event of the first ListBox.

For the full implementation, refer to [this Dojo example](https://dojo.telerik.com/uPowuQoq). If the arrows from the toolbar are used, you need to apply similar logic to the [`add`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/listbox/events/add) event (with timeout).
