## Environment

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Progress® Kendo UI® Grid for jQuery</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

Your project might require the remote CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations to use the ASMX service.

## Solution

To see the example on how to achieve this behavior, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net/tree/master/grid-web-service-crud). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET Web technologies](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net).
