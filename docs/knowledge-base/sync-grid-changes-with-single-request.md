Your project might require you to send all updated, deleted, or new Grid records to the server with a single request.

To see the example, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc/tree/master/grid-data-serializer-class-for-serializng-data-and-send-all-update-new-deleted-records). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET MVC](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc).
