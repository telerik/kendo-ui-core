## Description

When I try to load the Kendo UI Grid wrapper for React in Internet Explorer (IE), the component does not load and the `Object doesn't support property or method 'assign'` error appears in the console. How can I load the Grid in IE?

## Possible Cause

The `ShimJS` library is not included in the page.

## Solution

Include the `ShimJS` library by adding `<script src="https://unpkg.com/core-js/client/shim.min.js"></script>`.
