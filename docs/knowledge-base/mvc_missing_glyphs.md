## Environment

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Product</td>
  <td>Progress® Telerik UI® for ASP.NET MVC</td>
 </tr>
</table>

## Description

The Kendo UI CDN loads the required glyph files automatically after including the CSS files. However, when I work with a local copy of the CSS files, the glyph files are not present.

## Possible Solution

To make the Web Font Icons visible, either:

* Include the missing files in the `fonts/glyphs` folder. These files are located in the [Kendo UI `.zip` file](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=KENDOUICOMPLETE), or
* Disable the CDN support by using the [Project Configuration Wizard](http://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/vs-integration/configure-project-wizard).
