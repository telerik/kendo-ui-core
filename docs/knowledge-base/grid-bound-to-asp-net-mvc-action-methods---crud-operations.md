Your project might require the remote CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations to use a Kendo UI Grid bound to ASP.NET MVC action methods.

To see the example on how to achieve this behavior, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc/tree/master/grid-crud). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET MVC](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc).

> To commit the `destroy` operations to the server, save the changes. Clicking **Delete** does not immediately hit the server.
