## Description

When I visit the Kendo UI Dojo, I see the message below. What does this message mean?

```
As of 10/03/2024, the user accounts functionality has been deprecated.
```

This KB also answers the following questions:
* Will I lose all of my snippets?
* How can I get a list with the existing snippets in my Dojo account?

The Dojo no longer supports registered accounts. You can keep on creating snippets and sharing them with others, however they will not be linked to a specific account.

The main functionality that has been removed, is the snippets list that was previously accessible through the `/snippets` page. On this page, you were previously able to view a list of all of the snippets created by that account. This page will no longer be available. If you want to keep track of the created snippets, you have to either bookmark them or save them in a place of your choice.

## Solution

> Please contact us before the 3rd of April 2025(04/03/2025) for a list of snippets created using your account. After that, this information will be erased and we won't be able to retrieve account-specific lists.

The existing snippets WILL NOT be removed. All of the snippets that have been created over the years will remain available, including the ones created with your account. The urls of these snippets will remain unchanged.

If you need a list of your account-specific snippets, please open a [support ticket](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/technical-support) with the title `Request for Dojo Snippets` and share the email address with which the dojo account was created. Once we've exported your snippets, we'll send them in a `CSV` format to the provided email address.
