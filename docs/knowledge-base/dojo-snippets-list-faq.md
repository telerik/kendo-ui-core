## Description

The Dojo no longer supports registered accounts. You can keep on creating snippets and sharing them with others, however they will not be linked to a specific account.

The main functionality that has been removed, is the snippets list that was previously accessible through the `/snippets` page. On this page, you were previously able to view a list of all of the snippets created by that account. This page will no longer be available. If you want to keep track of the created snippets, you have to either bookmark them or save them in a place of your choice.
