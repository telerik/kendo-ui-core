## Description

I want to use the new checkbox-selection feature of the Grid. However, when I click on the checkbox in the header, the checkboxes of the Grid rows are not selected and when I do the paging, the Grid doesn't persist the checkboxes that were selected from other pages.

How can I extend the `kendo.ui.Grid` class and implement the checkbox selection in the Grid?

## Cause

Two of the private methods internally reference the Grid. As the widget is now called `kendoMyGrid`, the result is `undefined` and the additional logic is not executed.  

```
checkBox.closest(".k-grid.k-widget").data("kendoGrid")

// now it should be

checkBox.closest(".k-grid.k-widget").data("kendoMyGrid")
```

## Solution

Overwrite the two methods. Note that because the methods are private, their modification might cause unexpected behavior.  

For the complete implementation of the approach, refer to [this runnable example](https://dojo.telerik.com/usiZiM/2).
