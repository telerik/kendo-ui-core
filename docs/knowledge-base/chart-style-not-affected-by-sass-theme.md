## Environment

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Product</td>
  <td>Progress® Telerik® UI Chart for ASP.NET MVC</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Operating System</td>

## Description

I created a new SASS theme by using the Kendo UI ThemeBuilder tool, downloaded it, and added a reference to it in my `Layout.cshtml` file. The theme works as expected for the whole application but it doesn't affect the Charts even though I chose new colors for the series.

## Cause

The Charts require you to set a custom property before they recognize the new styles.

## Solution

Set the `theme` property of the Kendo UI Charts to `"sass"`.

````c#
@(Html.Kendo().Chart()
  .Name("bar")
  .Theme("sass")
````
