Your project might require you to initialize a Kendo UI Grid within a Kendo UI TabStrip.

To achieve this behavior, use the `activate` event to resize the Grid according to the dimensions of its container. To see the example, refer to [this how-to article]({% slug initialize_thegrid_tabstrip_widget %}).
