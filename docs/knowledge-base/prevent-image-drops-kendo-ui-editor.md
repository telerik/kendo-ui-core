## Description
I want to prevent users from dropping images into the [Editor for Progress速 Kendo UI速](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/editors/editor/overview). This knowledge base article also answers the following questions:
- How can I stop images from being pasted into the Editor?
- What method can I use to block image drops in the Editor?
- Is there a way to disable image pasting in the Editor?

## Solution
To prevent an image from being dropped into the Editor, utilize the [`paste`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/editor/events/paste) event. In the event handler, check if the pasted content includes an `<img>` tag and stop the event's propagation if it does. 

Here's how you can implement this solution:

```dojo
<textarea id="editor"></textarea>
<script>
$("#editor").kendoEditor({
  paste: function(e) {
    if(e.html.includes("img")) {
      e.stopPropagation();
    }
  }
});
</script>
```

This code checks the HTML content being pasted and cancels the event if an `<img>` tag is found, effectively preventing the image from being dropped into the Editor.
