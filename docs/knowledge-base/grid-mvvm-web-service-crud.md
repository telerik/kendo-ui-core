## Environment

<table>

		<td>Progress速 Kendo UI速 Grid for jQuery</td>
		<td>Progress速 Kendo UI速 MVVM Architecture</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Description

Your project might require the remote CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations to use a Grid bound through MVVM (ASP.NET back-end).

## Solution

To see the example on how to achieve this behavior, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net/tree/master/grid-mvvm-web-service-crud). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET Web technologies](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net).
