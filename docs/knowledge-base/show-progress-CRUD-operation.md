Your project might require you to show the current progress of each CRUD operation for a Kendo UI Grid.

To see the example, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc/tree/master/grid-progressbar-crud-operations). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET MVC](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc). For an additional example on this scenario, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/GridProgressBarForCRUDOperations).
