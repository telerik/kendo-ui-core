Your project might require you to show a preview of an image in a window in the Grid by using MVVM.

To see the example, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc/tree/master/grid-show-preview-image-mvvm). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET MVC](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc).
