## Description

When the Grid data is sent from the Controller to the client and I cannot get any records to load in any of the grids in my ASP.NET Core project. What is the cause and how can I handle this issues?

## Cause

By default, the data in .NET Core is serialized in camelCase, while the property names in the Model are usually in PascalCase. As a result, in this scenario the DataSource of the Grid does not recognize the fields in the data that is returned by the server.

## Solution

Edit the `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup.cs`.  

```
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        // Maintain property names during serialization. See:
        // https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/194
        services
            .AddMvc()
            .AddJsonOptions(options => options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = null);

        // Add Kendo UI services to the services container
        services.AddKendo();
    }
```
