Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery AppBar provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The AppBar is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The AppBar component is a container for elements and does not implement any wai-aria attributes.

## Section 508


The AppBar is fully compliant with the [Section 508 requirements](http://www.section508.gov/).

## Testing


The AppBar has been extensively tested automatically with [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and manually with the most popular screen readers.

> To report any accessibility issues, contact the team through the [Telerik Support System](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center).
