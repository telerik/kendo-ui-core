# {{ site.product }} DockManager Overview

The Dock Manager is a UI component that replicates the docks, along with their behaviors. It gives you the ability to have full control over the layout of your application through panes. This allows end users to alter the existing layout by pinning, resizing, moving, maximizing and hiding panes.
