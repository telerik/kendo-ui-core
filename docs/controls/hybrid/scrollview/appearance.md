>Starting with the R2 2023 release, Kendo UI will no longer ship Hybrid UI components. This means that the R2 2023 will be the last release to include Kendo Hybrid in the Kendo UI package. See full announcement in [Kendo jQuery blog post](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/r2-2023-kendo-ui-release#end-of-support-announcements). The last stable version that we recommend to use for Kendo Hybrid components is [R3 2022 SP1](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/kendo-ui/release-history/kendo-ui-r3-2022-sp1-(version-2022-3-1109)).

You can render a pager overlay in the Nova theme by adding the `km-scrollview-overlay` class to the ScrollView element.

    <div data-role="scrollView" class="km-scrollview-overlay">
        <div data-role="page">Foo</div>
        <div data-role="page">Bar</div>
    </div>
