# Windows Phone 8 FAQ

This is a collection of frequently asked questions and their answers about how Kendo UI hybrid mobile components work and behave on the Windows Phone 8 platform.

## List of FAQ

### My icons do not render in Windows Phone 8 PhoneGap or HTML5 apps. Can I do something about it?

Local web fonts are not loaded in Windows Phone 8 (WP8) HTML5/PhoneGap apps or fonts loaded from local CSS. According to some sources, external CSS should load web fonts, but Kendo UI is not able to confirm this. As a workaround, use normal images for icons in WP8 HTML5/PhoneGap applications.

### I get a grey background when I click on a link or label in Hybrid UI under WP8. Why?

By default, WP8 highlights all links when they are active (hold down). Stopping this behavior requires manually adding a meta tag to your application/site&mdash;adding the tag through JavaScript is ignored.

The example below demonstrates the meta tag you need to add to work around this issue.



    <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight" content="no" />

### When I change the WP8 theme, my application starts to look different. Why?

The Hybrid UI framework adapts to the current theme in WP8 and changes the background and highlight colors of your application. In the browser this is semi-automatic when you click inside the application to focus it, but in PhoneGap it happens automatically on the application resume after you change the theme.
