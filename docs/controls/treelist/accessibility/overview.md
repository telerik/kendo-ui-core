# TreeList Accessibility

The TreeList is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

 For more information, refer to:

* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})




Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery TreeList provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The TreeList is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The TreeList is a composite component that consists of 2 logically separated structural elements:


 - Toolbar (`role=toolbar`);
 - Tree Grid (`role=treegrid`);

### TreeList Toolbar


TreeList Toolbar follows the specification of the ToolBar component.

[ToolBar accessibility specification]({{toolbar_a11y_link}})

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-grid-toolbar` | `role=toolbar` | The toolbar is a collection of command buttons and inputs. |
|  | `aria-label` | Clarifies the purpose of the toolbar. |
|  | `aria-controls=.k-grid-aria-root id` | Pointing to the id of the element with `role=treegrid`. |

### Tree Grid


The element with `role=treegrid` must not include the ToolBar element as it does not belong to the `role=treegrid` element itself. It implements the ARIA specification for the Grid component with some exceptions listed below.

[Grid accessibility specification]({{grid_a11y_link}})


In the Kendo jQuery TreeList, the `role=treegrid` is assigned to the `<table>` in the `k-grid-content` element.


The below table lists the ARIA requirements for the TreeList which are not present in the Grid specification:

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-grid-content>table` | `role=treegrid` | The role specifies the element is a TreeGrid. |
| `.k-table-tbody .k-table-row` | `aria-expanded=true/false` | Set on the currently expanded row(s). |
| `.k-table-tbody .k-i-caret-alt-down,.k-table-tbody .k-i-caret-alt-right,.k-table-tbody .k-svg-i-caret-alt-down,.k-table-tbody .k-svg-i-caret-alt-right` | `aria-hidden=true` | Removes the expand/collapse icon from the accessibility tree. |
