# {{ site.product }} Button Overview

The Button provides consistent styling for a clickable UI functionality rendering arbitrary content and also keyboard operability for elements that do not natively support such (for example, `span`).

You can initialize a single Button or multiple Buttons at once depending on your requirements. 

Following the web standards requirements not to place block elements (for example, `a` or `span`) inside inline elements (for example, `div` or `p`), you can use the Button to host both element types. 

However, note that due to the special and individual behavior of clickable elements, placing hyperlinks or textboxes inside the Button may cause undesired side effects.
