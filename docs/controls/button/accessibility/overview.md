Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery Button provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Button is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | If the used element is not `<button>`, explicitly set its `role` to `button`. |
|  | `aria-label` | If no text has been provided to an Icon Button, announces the purpose of the Button. |
