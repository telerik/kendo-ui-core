# MediaPlayer Accessibility

The MediaPlayer does not comply with the Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 requirements. Its major deficit is the lack of captions. Such a feature is not currently planned for implementation.

For more information on the keyboard navigation in the widget, please refer to the [Keyboard navigation demo of the Kendo UI MediaPlayer]({% slug keynav_mediaplayer_jquery %})
