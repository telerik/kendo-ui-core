# {{ site.product }} MediaPlayer Overview

The MediaPlayer plays video files from static sources or streams online YouTube videos and enriches your website with dynamic content in a user-friendly interface.

The MediaPlayer also provides a styled video UI functionality by using the HTML5 `<video>` element and brings powerful media capabilities to your applications without the necessity of installing additional plug-ins. It delivers tight integration with the YouTube media provider, rich media web experience for websites, blogs, online TV channels, e-commerce pages, and others, and enables the integration of Kendo UI components. In addition to the consistent and elegant built-in skins, the MediaPlayer possesses the main feature of every Kendo UI component&mdash;it is a useful and convenient tool designed for achieving fascinating results in a sharp time frame.

To respond to cutting-end design practices and trends, the MediaPlayer component provides a responsive layout. This means that its size adapts depending on the capabilities of the client (end user) device and browser. The component automatically resizes its area to display the video in the most suitable possible way within the provided dimensions. The responsive web design of the MediaPlayer is shipped out-of-the-box and intends to save you time and efforts when developing your responsive applications.
