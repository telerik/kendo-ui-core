Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery Bottom Navigation provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Bottom Navigation is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The Bottom Navigation component is a landmark `<nav>` element or an element with `role="navigation"`(https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#navigation). It contains an ordered list of navigation items. Each navigation item contains a link.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-bottom-nav` | `role=navigation` or `nodeName=nav` | The landmark role `navigation` must be assigned to the bottom navigation. |
| `.k-bottom-nav-item` | `role=link` or `nodeName=a` | Associate the link purpose of the bottom navigation items. |
| `.k-bottom-nav-item.k-selected` | `aria-current=true` | Associate the link purpose of the bottom navigation items. |
