Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery ColorPalette provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The ColorPalette is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-colorpalette` | `role=grid` | The focusable wrapper of the component should announce its role as a `grid`. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The component needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. Must also include the currently selected value in the component. |
|  | `aria-activedescendant=.k-colorpalette-tile.k-focus id` | Points to the focused cell in the table. The focused cell is changed via keyboard navigation. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | The element must be focusable. |
| `.k-colorpalette.k-disabled` | `aria-disabled=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the ColorPalette is disabled. |
| `.k-colorpalette-table` | `role=none/presentation` | Negates the default role of the element, as it is wrapped within a `role="grid"` element. |
| `.k-colorpalette-table>tbody>tr` | `role=row` | Required as the semantic role of its parent `<table>` has been removed. |
| `.k-colorpalette-tile` | `role=gridcell` | Required as the semantic role of its parent `<table>` has been removed. |
|  | `aria-label` or `title` | The text representation of the color value for the current cell. |
| `.k-colorpalette-tile.k-selected` | `aria-selected=true` | Present on the currently selected cell in the component. |
