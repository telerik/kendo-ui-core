# DatePicker Accessibility

The DatePicker is accessible by screen readers and provides [`WAI-ARIA`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), [`Section 508`](https://www.section508.gov/), [`WCAG 2.2`](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), and keyboard support.

* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})




Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery DatePicker provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The DatePicker is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

### DatePicker Wrapping Element

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=combobox` | The input element should follow the `combobox` specification. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-haspopup=grid` | Indicates the component has a Calendar Popup that implements `role="grid"`. |
|  | `aria-expanded=true/false` | Announces whether the Popup is visible or not. |
|  | `aria-controls=.k-animation-container id` | Points to the popup element. Signifies that the `combobox` element controls the Calendar `grid`. |
|  | `aria-activedescendant=.k-calendar-td.k-focus id` | Points to the focused item (date/month/year) in the Calendar Popup. Should only be present when the Popup is open. |
|  | `readonly=readonly` or `aria-readonly=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the DatePicker is readonly. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the combobox is in form and announces the valid state of the component. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | The element must be focusable. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the DatePicker is disabled. |
| `.k-input-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | The element should either be a `<button>` element or should have `role="button"` assigned. |
|  | `aria-label` | The button needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `tabindex=-1` | Button element should not be focusable. |

### Calendar Popup


The Calendar in the Popup element of the component should implement the specification for the **Calendar** component.
