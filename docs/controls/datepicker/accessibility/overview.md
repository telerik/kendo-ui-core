# DatePicker Accessibility

The DatePicker is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})

## WAI-ARIA

The component follows the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for implementing the keyboard navigation for its component role and is tested against the popular screen readers. For more information, refer to the article on [WAI-ARIA support in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug wai_aria_accessibility_support %}).

To customize the `aria-label` text of the currently focused cell in the calendar, use the [`ARIATemplate`](/api/javascript/ui/datepicker/configuration/ariatemplate) configuration option.

## Section 508

The DatePicker is compliant with the Section 508 requirements. For more information, refer to the article on [Section 508 support in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug section508_accessibility_support %}).

## WCAG 2.2

The DatePicker supports the standards for providing accessible web content which are set by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). For more information, refer to the article on [WCAG 2.2 compliance in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug section508_wcag21_accessibility_support %})
