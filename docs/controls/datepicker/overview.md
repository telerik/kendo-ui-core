# {{ site.product }} DatePicker Overview

The DatePicker enables the user to select a date from a calendar or through a direct input.

It provides options for using custom templates for its **Month** view, setting minimum and maximum dates, a start view, and a depth for navigation.

## Functionality and Features

|Feature|Definition
|:---|:---
| [Disabled dates]({% slug disableddates_datepicker %})|In the DatePicker, you can disable specific days, such as weekends and national holidays, so that they cannot be selected by the end user.
| [Selected dates]({% slug selecteddates_datepicker %})|The DatePicker allows you to render pre-selected dates and define date ranges. 
| [Start View and Navigation Depth]({% slug navdepth_datepicker %})|You can set the initial DatePicker view and define the view depth to which the user can navigate.
| [Input value validation]({% slug validation_datepicker %})|While, by design, the DatePicker keeps its input value unchanged, it still provides options for you to utilize a client-validation framework and render prompt error messages. 
| [Calendar types]({% slug calendartypes_datepicker %})|Even though the DatePicker supports only the Gregorian calendar by default, you can still simulate other calendar types such as Lunar. 
| [Week number column]({% slug weeknumcolumn_datepicker %})|The DatePicker enables you to display a column with the number of weeks within the current **Month** view.
| [DateInput integration]({% slug dateinputintegration_datepicker %})|You can smoothly integrate the DatePicker with the Kendo UI for jQuery DateInput control for its displayed input element.
| [Templates]({% slug templates_datepicker %})|The DatePicker supports the implementation of templates which enable you to customize its elements such as cells, footer, and week column.   
| [Automatic Correction]({% slug autocorrect_kendoui_datepicker %})|You can configure whether the component will autocorrect the user's input when the `min` and `max` dates are set.
| [Globalization]({% slug globalization_datepicker %})|The DatePicker supports globalization to ensure that it can fit well in any application, no matter what [languages and locales]({% slug localization_datepicker %}) need to be supported. Additionally, the DatePicker supports [rendering in a right-to-left (RTL) direction]({% slug rtl_datepicker %}).
| [Accessibility]({% slug accessibility_datepicker %})|The DatePicker is accessible for screen readers, supports WAI-ARIA attributes, and delivers [keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation]({% slug keynav_datepicker %}).
