# {{ site.product }} Captcha Overview

The Kendo UI Captcha component is a security measure that prevents automated spam from performing tasks such as form submissions in your application. The widget generates distorted images of letters and numbers that are easily decipherable to humans, but not to automated programs (spam bots).

## Functionality and Features

* [Audio]({% slug audio_kendoui_captcha_widget %})&mdash;The Captcha component can generate a voice representation of the Captcha text.
* [Provider]({% slug provider_kendoui_captcha_widget %})&mdash;The provider generates and validates Captchas through helper classes and methods.
* [Validation]({% slug validation_kendoui_captcha_widget %})&mdash;Using the server-side validation handler for the Captcha guarantees that no programs or bots can access the values of the Captcha on the client-side through JavaScript and then bypass the validation.
