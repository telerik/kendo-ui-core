# {{ site.product }} DateTimePicker Overview

The DateTimePicker allows the user to select a value from a calendar or from a time drop-down list, or through their direct input.

The DateTimePicker supports configurable options for minimum and maximum value, date and time formats, intervals between predefined hours in the **Time** view, custom templates for the **Month** view of the calendar, start view, and a depth for navigation. The first day of the week in the **Calendar** view depends on the applied [culture]({% slug culture_definition_kendoui_globalization %}).
