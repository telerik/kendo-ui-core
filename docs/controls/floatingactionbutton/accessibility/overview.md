# FloatingActionButton Accessibility

The FloatingActionButton is accessible by screen readers and provides [`WAI-ARIA`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), [`Section 508`](https://www.section508.gov/), [`WCAG 2.2`](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), and keyboard support.

> The described level of compliance is achievable with the [`Ocean Blue A11y Accessibility Swatch`](/accessibility/themes-swatches).

Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery FloatingActionButton provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The FloatingActionButton is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The FloatingActionButton features two distinct modes of operation: button-only and button-with-menu.

### Button-Only Mode

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-fab` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | Omitted if the `<button>` DOM element is used. |
|  | `aria-label` or `title` | The attribute must be present when no text is initially visible in the button. |
| `.k-fab.k-disabled` | `aria-disabled=true` | Rendered only when the button is disabled and the `disabled` attribute cannot be used. Applicable for the `<button>` or `<input type="button">` elements. |

### Button-with-Menu Mode


In the button-with-menu mode, the FloatingActionButton must implement the specification for the DropDownButton component.
