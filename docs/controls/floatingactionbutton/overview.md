# Overview

The FloatingActionButton is a UI component that is tied to the most logical action that we expect from a user looking at a particular screen. For example, the most logical action for a user looking at the main screen of a mobile messaging app is to write a message. You can implement a FloatingActionButton that allows the user to compose a new message.

The FloatingActionButton floats in the application above other items, and its main action directly corresponds to the content on the screen. Apart from being a single button with a single action, the FloatingActionButton can also be configured to display additional related actions or speed dial actions.
