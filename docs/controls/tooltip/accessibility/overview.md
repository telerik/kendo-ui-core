# Tooltip Accessibility

The Tooltip is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

 For more information, refer to [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %}).




Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery Tooltip provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Tooltip is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

|  | `id` | The element needs an id to be associated with the aria-describedby attribute of the trigger element. |
