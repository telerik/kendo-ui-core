# Adaptive Mode

The Kendo UI for jQuery ColorPicker supports an adaptive mode that allows the component to render a mobile-friendly popup. The popup will adjust its size and accommodate its content based on the current screen size.

> Starting with the 2025 Q2 release, when the `adaptiveMode` property is enabled and the component is accessed on a mobile device, the popup will open as soon as the component receives focus. In previous versions, the popup only opened once the user began typing.

To set the adaptive mode, use the `adaptiveMode` option.
