# CheckBox Accessibility

The CheckBox is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

For more information, refer to [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %}).




Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery CheckBox provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The CheckBox is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-checkbox` | `role=checkbox` or `type=checkbox` | Announces the `checkbox` role of the element. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input requires an accessible name to which it will be assigned. |
|  | `aria-checked=true` or `checked=checked` | Announces the checked state of the CheckBox. |
|  | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the CheckBox is disabled. |
| `.k-invalid,.ng-invalid` | `aria-invalid=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the CheckBox is in a `form` HTML element and announces the invalid state of the component. |
