# Stepper Accessibility

The Stepper is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

 For more information, refer to:

* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})




Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery Stepper provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Stepper is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The Stepper component is a landmark `<nav>` element or an element with `role="navigation"`(https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#navigation). It contains an ordered list of navigation items. Each navigation item contains a link.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-stepper` | `role=navigation` or `nodeName=nav` | The landmark role `navigation` must be assigned to the component. |
| `.k-step-disabled>.k-step-link` | `aria-disabled=true` | A disabled (inactive) link. |
| `.k-step-current>.k-step-link` | `aria-current=step` | The currently selected link. |
| `.k-step.k-focus .k-step-link` | `tabindex=0` | Adds an element to the page's tab order. Set based on the roving tabindex navigation when the tab is focused. |
| `.k-step:not(.k-focus) .k-step-link` | `tabindex=-1` | Removes the element from the page's tab order. Set based on the roving tabindex navigation when a tab is not focused. |


No aria attributes should be applied to the Stepper as the ProgressBar serves a purely aesthetic purpose.
