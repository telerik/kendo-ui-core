# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the ContextMenu is always available.

When the ContextMenu gets opened its first item is focused. When the ContextMenu gets closed, in case the target element is focusable it gets focused.


Kendo UI ContextMenu supports the following keyboard shortcuts:
