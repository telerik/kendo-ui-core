# {{ site.product }} Dialog Overview

The Dialog is a modal popup that brings information to the user.

The component also provides actions through its action buttons to prompt the user for input or to ask for a decision. The Dialog can also contain more complex UI elements that require the focus of the user. 

The Dialog is a subset of the [Kendo UI for jQuery Window](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/window) where the most prominent difference is the added functionality for actions and predefined dialogs.
