# {{ site.product }} TileLayout Overview

> The TileLayout widget is available as of Kendo UI R2 2020(v2020.2.513).

The Kendo UI TileLayout widget allows you configure a two-dimensional grid-based sandbox surface to display content in tiles which can be dragged around and rearranged to create any modern page design.

The TileLayout is based on the [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) with all its features and uses additional JavaScript logic to provide resizing, reordering, and template customizations.
