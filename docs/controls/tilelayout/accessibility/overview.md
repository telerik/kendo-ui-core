Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery TileLayout provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The TileLayout is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AAA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| `.k-tilelayout` | `role=list` | Sets list role to the TileLayout wrapper. |
| `.k-tilelayout-item` | `role=listitem` | Sets listitem role to the TileLayout items. |
|  | `aria-labelledby` | Associates the focusable item wrapper with the respective header text element (.k-tilelayout-item-header .k-card-title). |
|  | `tabindex=0` | Makes the item wrapper element focusable. |
|  | `aria-keyshortcuts=Enter` | Announces Enter as an available key shortcut when the item is focused. |
|  | `aria-dropeffect=execute` | Announces that an action, supported by the drop-target (resizing or reordering) will be executed when the item is dropped. |
|  | `aria-grabbed=true/false` | The aria-grabbed state indicates an element's 'grabbed' state in a drag-and-drop operation. |
| `.k-tilelayout-item-header .k-card-title` | `id` | Unique and deterministic identifier to link the header text element to the focusable wrapper. |
