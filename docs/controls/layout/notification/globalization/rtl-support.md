# Right-to-Left Support

Right-to-left (RTL) support reflects the ability of a widget to render its content in a right-to-left direction for right-to-left languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, or Japanese.

The provision of proper right-to-left support for the popup notifications when you use the built-in notification templates requires the originating element of the Notification to be a descendant of an element with a `k-rtl` class. Static notifications which use built-in templates also have to be descendants of such a `.k-rtl` element.
