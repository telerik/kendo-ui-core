# Adaptive Mode

The Kendo UI for jQuery AutoComplete provides adaptive mode&mdash;built-in mobile-friendly rendering of its popup that accommodates the component content based on the current screen size.

> Starting with the 2025 Q2 release, when the `adaptiveMode` property is enabled and the component is accessed on a mobile device, the popup will open as soon as the component receives focus. In previous versions, the popup only opened once the user began typing. d

To set the adaptive mode, use the `adaptiveMode` option.

# On-Screen Keyboard

To enhance the mobile user experience of your application, you can configure the type of the on-screen keyboard for the AutoComplete component.

To configure an on-screen keyboard for the AutoComplete, set the `inputMode` property to a supported value. Based on the defined setting, the browser will display the most appropriate virtual keyboard on the screen.

The following example demonstrates how to configure an on-screen keyboard for the Kendo UI for jQuery AutoComplete.

```dojo
    <input id="products" style="width: 100%;" />                
    <script>
      $(document).ready(function() {
        $("#products").kendoAutoComplete({
          inputMode: "search",
          dataTextField: "text",
          dataSource: [
            {text: "Apples"},
            {text: "Oranges"},
            {text: "Bananas"}
          ]                
        });
      });
    </script>
```
