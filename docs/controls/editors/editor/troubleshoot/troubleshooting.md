# Common Issues

This page provides solutions for common issues you may encounter while working with the Kendo UI Editor widget.

## Pasting

### Pasting Displays Nothing: Internet Explorer

Pasting in the Editor requires permission to access **Clipboard** data. This may require users with strict security settings to add the site in the trusted site zone, or to adjust their Internet options so that the **Allow Programmatic Clipboard Access** setting is set to either **Allowed** or **Prompt**.

### Pasted MS Word Styles Are Not Retained

By design, the Editor strives to output a clean, XHTML-compatible markup. Because of that, the widget cleans up invalid styles set by Microsoft Word, and removes the most presentational styles. Such styles include the colors applied by the current theme and the default MS Word font and size. Ideally, the output of the Editor should be styled via a stylesheet provided through the [stylesheets configuration option](/api/javascript/ui/editor#configuration-stylesheets). This allows all pasted content to be styled in a consistent manner across your site.

If wrong pasting removes semantics or actual content along with the styles, submit a bug report and attach an MS Word document that reproduces the problem.

## Editing and Formatting

### Formatting Shows BOM Characters in Editable Area

The Editor uses BOM characters to correctly handle some ranges. These characters become visible if there is a problem with the page encoding. To debug this, follow the steps:

1. If you observe the problem in the [online demos](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor), this might mean that your browser has enforced an encoding that is different from the UTF-8 one. This scenario is not supported.

1. If the online demos behave properly, change the Kendo UI script references so they are loaded from the CDN `http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/js/kendo.all.min.js`. If your page is now working correctly, then your local script files are served with the wrong encoding, or are corrupted. Copy over the scripts (the files, not their content) from the official distribution, and see if the problem persists.

1. If the problem is still visible on your page, and the scripts are loaded via the CDN, then it is likely that the page is served with the wrong formatting. Make sure the page, as well as its layout pages, are saved and served in UTF-8.

### Editor in Popup Is Readonly: Firefox

Firefox cannot handle `iframe` elements properly when they are moved to the DOM. When an Editor is used inside a popup, which moves elements to the DOM, the popup (e.g., a Kendo UI Window, a jQuery dialog, etc.) must be initialized first, or you must call the [`refresh` method](/api/javascript/ui/editor#methods-refresh).

## Layout and Display

### Editor in iPad Expands instead of Being Scrollable

Iframes cannot be scrollable in iOS and always expand to display all their content. A possible solution is to use the Editor's inline editing mode, which does not include an `iframe`. In this mode the Editor's value should be posted manually (see below).

### Images and Tables Are Not Resizable

Image and table resizing inside `contenteditable` elements depends on the browser. As a result of browser behavior, images may become non-resizable if a "classic" Editor (which uses an `iframe`) is created while hidden, or is hidden after its initialization and then displayed back.

As the reason for th–µ issue lies in browser functionalities, it can be resolved by calling the Editor's [`refresh`](/api/javascript/ui/editor#methods-refresh) method after the Editor becomes visible. Refreshing the widget will recreate the `iframe`.

Another possible approach is to use the Editor's inline mode, i.e., create the Editor from a `div` element.

To achieve image or table resizing in browsers such as Google Chrome 46 that do not normally support it, implement a [custom Editor tool](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor/custom-tools).

### Back and Forward Browser Buttons Display Raw HTML

The Editor stores its value encoded by default. When the page is retrieved from the `bfcache` (back-forward cache), the `textarea` value is persisted encoded and the Editor encodes it again. This process can be easily observed if you navigate several times back and forth. On each navigation, the Editor value will be encoded once more. To resolve the problem, set the [`encoded`](/api/javascript/ui/editor#configuration-encoded) property to `false`, and expect the Editor value to be posted unencoded to the server. If you are using ASP.NET, be sure to either disable the ASP.NET security validation, or set the `AllowHtml` attribute on the model field that will receive the HTML string. Here is some more [information about requesting validation in ASP.NET](http://blogs.learnnowonline.com/blog/bid/199703/ASP-NET-MVC-Request-Validation-Protection-AllowHtml-Attribute).

Another option is to enable the [inline Editor mode](/web/editor/overview#classic-mode-vs-inline-mode), which does not use an `iframe` and a `textarea`. In this case, however, the Editor's value must be [submitted manually](/getting-started/web/editor/troubleshooting#inline-editor-value-is-not-posted-to-the-server).

The browser's back-forward cache can be disabled by attaching a `window.unload` handler.

###### Example

    $(window).unload(function() {
      // nothing required here
    });

## Server Communication

### Inline Value Is Not Posted to Server

Since the inline Editor is initialized from a non-`form` element, it is not posted to the server by design. If you need to submit the editor value along with the `form`, use the following approach:

    <form>
      <div id="comment" contentEditable></div>

      <button class="k-button">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <script>
      $("form").on("submit", function() {
        var form = $(this);

        // for each editor in the form
        form.find("[data-role=editor]").each(function() {
          var editor = $(this).data("kendoEditor");

          // ... append a hidden input that holds the editor value
          $("<input type='hidden' />")
            .attr("name", editor.element.attr("id"))
            .val(editor.value())
            .appendTo(form);
        });
      });
    </script>
