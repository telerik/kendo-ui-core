# Start View and Selection Depth

The DateRangePicker enables you to set the initial view it renders and define the navigation depth of the views.

To define the initially rendered view, use the `start` option. To control the navigation depth, use the `depth` option.

The **Calendar** view supports the following predefined views:
* `month`&mdash;Shows the days of the month.
* `year`&mdash;Shows the months of the year.
* `decade`&mdash;Shows the years of the decade.
* `century`&mdash;Shows the decades of the century.

To enable the selection of dates for the range, set the `depth` to `month`.
