# MultiSelect Accessibility

The MultiSelect is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.1, and keyboard support.

For more information, refer to:
* [Keyboard navigation by the Kendo UI MultiSelect]({% slug keynav_kendoui_ddl_widget %})
* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})

## WAI-ARIA

The component follows the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for implementing the keyboard navigation for its component role and is tested against the popular screen readers. For more information, refer to the article on [WAI-ARIA support in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug wai_aria_accessibility_support %}).

The MultiSelect has three building blocks which, depending on the current state of the widget and its options, use different aria properties on their nested elements:

* Search input&mdash;Filters the list of choices.
* Tag list&mdash;Displays the selected values.
* Items popup&mdash;Displays the list of items that can be selected.

### Search Input

If the `placeholder` option is set, in order for screen readers to announce the placeholder text, the WAI-ARIA `label` attribute has to be manually toggled on the `input` element.

The MultiSelect implements the following WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties for its search input:

| Role     | Attribute             | Usage                                       |
|----------|---------------------- |---------------------------------------------|
|[`listbox`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#listbox)  |                              | Identifies the popup with items.

In order for the screen readers to announce the selected options after deleting an item from the tag list:

The MultiSelect implements the following WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties for its tag list:
