# Server Filtering

The [Kendo UI AutoComplete](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/autocomplete/index), the [ComboBox](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/combobox/index), the [DropDownList](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/dropdownlist/index) and the [MultiSelect](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/multiselect/index) widgets support server filtering, which is useful for displaying only a data subset.

Basically, the widget displays just the data returned from the server. Server filtering can be used to display a reduced portion of the whole dataset, which is convenient to apply when end users cannot or do not want to see the whole dataset in the popup element.

## Configuration

Server-filtering is based on the filtering capability of the DataSource component. That being said, you need to be familiar with the filtering configuration of the component. For more information, refer to the [DataSource `serverFiltering`](/api/javascript/data/datasource#configuration-serverFiltering) option.

Once you configure the DataSource to perform server filtering, the only widget option that needs to be defined additionally is the [`filter`](/api/javascript/ui/combobox#configuration-filter) one.

For a detailed reference how to configure the server filtering functionality, refer to the [ComboBox server filtering demo](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/combobox/serverfiltering).

## Advantages

The server-filtering feature can be used to display only a subset of a dataset. This is quite useful when the dataset is large and contains thousands or more records. In such situations, define a minimum filter length by using the [`minLength`](/api/javascript/ui/combobox#configuration-minLength) option. For instance, if you set this option to `3`, the widget will not start filtering the dataset until at least 3 characters are entered.

Another benefit that server filtering brings about is the option to bind the widget to only one data item&mdash;the selected one. In this way, you avoid the need to retrieve the whole dataset when you want to display the selected value or text. This approach boosts the loading time of the widget.

To apply the approach, send the selected value to the server and return only the matching data item. Use the  [`data`](/api/javascript/data/datasource#configuration-transport.read.data) callback of the DataSource.

###### Example

```javascript
    data: function() {
        //the selectedValue is used on the server to filter the source and return only the matching data item
        return {
            selectedValue: $("#[widget id]").data("kendoComboBox").value()
        }
    }
```

## Known Limitations

The server filtering feature (as its name indicates) only filters the source. To page (and filter) the data set, use the [Virtualization]({% slug virtualization_kendoui_combobox_widget %}) feature of the widget.
