# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the Upload is always available.

The Upload enables you to focus the **Select Files** button and press **Enter** to open the file-selection dialog. For the complete example, refer to the [demo on Kendo UI Dojo](https://dojo.telerik.com/@nenchef/OPAQAjOk).
