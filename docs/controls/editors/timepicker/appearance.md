# TimePicker Appearance

> As of Kendo UI R1 2022, the TimePicker widget uses brand new rendering.

In this article, you will find information about the new rendering of the Kendo UI TimePicker.

For additional information regarding the decision behind these changes, visit the [Styling Overview]({% slug components_rendering_overview %}) article.

For a live example, visit the [Appearance Demo of the TimePicker](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/timepicker/appearance).

## Options

The Kendo UI TimePicker supports the following styling options:

- [`size`](#size)—configures the overall size of the component.
- [`fillMode`](#fillmode)—configures how the color is applied to the component.
- [`rounded`](#rounded)—configures the border radius of the component.

### Size

The `size` option controls how big or small the rendered `input` looks. The structure of the class is `k-input-{size}`.

The following values are available for the [`size`](/api/javascript/ui/timepicker/configuration/size) option:

- `sm`—small size
- `md`—medium size
- `lg`—large size
- `none`—unset

The default size value is `medium` and it is applied to the wrapping span element through the `k-input-md` class.

```html
<span class="k-timepicker k-input k-input-md">
</span>
``` 

### Rounded

The `rounded` option controls the border radius of the rendered `input`. The structure of the class is `k-rounded-{size}`.

The following values are available for the [`rouned`](/api/javascript/ui/timepicker/configuration/rounded) option:

- `sm`—small border radius
- `md`—medium border radius
- `lg`—large border radius
- `full`—ellipse-like border radius
- `none`—unset

The structure of the class is `k-rounded-{size}`.

The default rounded value is `medium` and it is applied to the wrapping span element through the `k-rounded-md` class.

```html
<span class="k-timepicker k-input k-rounded-md">
</span>
```

### FillMode

The `fillMode` option controls the way the color is applied to the rendered `input`. The structure of the class is `k-input-{fillMode}`

The following values are available for the [`fillMode`](/api/javascript/ui/timepicker/configuration/fillmode) option:

- `solid`
- `flat`
- `outline`
- `none`

The default fillMode value is `solid` and it is applied to the wrapping span element through the `k-input-solid` class.

```html
<span class="k-timepicker k-input k-input-solid">
</span>
```

## Old vs New Rendering

The old rendering of the TimePicker consisted of an input with a single class named `k-input`. The input was wrapped in a span element with the `k-timepicker` class that held all the styling information related to the widget.

```html
 <!-- OLD -->
<span class="k-widget k-timepicker" style="width: 100%;">
     <span class="k-picker-wrap k-state-default">
        <input class="k-input" >
     </span>
  </span>
```

The new rendering of the component consists of a wrapping `span` element that has a child `input` element. The `span` element controls the overall appearance of the widget depending on the applied classes and has the following class structure:

```html
<!-- NEW -->
    <span class="k-timepicker k-input k-input-md k-rounded-md k-input-solid">
       <input type="text" class="k-input-inner" value="..." placeholder="..." />
    </span>
```

The following example demonstrates how to configure the appearance of the widget through its configuration:

```dojo
<input id="timepicker" />
<script>
$("#timepicker").kendoTimePicker({
    size: "medium",
    rounded: "medium",
    fillMode: "solid",
});
</script>
```

## Visual Backwards Compatibility

> The new styling and rendering supports only the [default options](#options) when you use a LESS theme.

Previously, you had to obtain a reference to the timepicker element through the `k-input` class.

```javascript
$(".k-input") // Returns a reference to the TimePicker element in the old rendering.
```

With the new rendering, you must target the timepicker element by using the `k-input-inner` class.

```javascript
$(".k-input-inner") // Returns a reference to the TimePicker element in the new rendering.
```

The following example showcases how to change the background colors of the input and button elements of the **TimePicker** in both the new, and the old rendering:

```dojo
   <!-- Open the example in Dojo and select version prior to 2022 R1 to see the difference in the appearance -->
    <div id="parent">
      <input id="timepicker" />
    </div>

    <style>
      /* Doesn't work AFTER R1 2022 */
      #parent .k-input {
        background-color: #0071bc !important; /* Blue color in versions BEFORE R1 2022 */
      }
      #parent .k-select {
        background-color: red; /* Applies red color to the date button element BEFORE R1 2022 */
      }

      /* Doesn't work BEFORE R1 2022 */
      #parent .k-input-inner {
        background-color: #2e8540 !important; /* Green color in versions AFTER R1 2022 */
      }
      #parent .k-input-button {
        background-color: yellow; /* Applies yellow color to the date button element AFTER R1 2022 */
      }
    </style>

    <script>
      $("#timepicker").kendoTimePicker();
    </script>
```
