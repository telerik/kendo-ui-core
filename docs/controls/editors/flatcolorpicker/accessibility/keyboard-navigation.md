# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the FlatColorPicker is always available.

The Kendo UI FlatColorPicker supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

| SHORTCUT						| DESCRIPTION				                                                        |
|:---                 |:---                                                                                |
| `Space/Enter`             | When the Toggle format button is focused, changes the format between RGB and HEX. When a View button is focused, switches to Palette or Gradient view.|
