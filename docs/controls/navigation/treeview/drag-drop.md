# Dragging and Dropping

When the drag-and-drop feature is enabled, the nodes of the TreeView can be dragged and dropped across all levels.

The functionality also features tooltips that help users indicate where the node will be dropped.

The following example demonstrates how to enable the drag-and-drop functionality for the TreeView nodes.

    $("#treeView").kendoTreeView({
        dragAndDrop: true
    });
