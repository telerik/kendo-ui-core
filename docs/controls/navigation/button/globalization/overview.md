# Button Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Button is enabled through:
* [Internationalization for culture locales]({% slug intl_button %})
* [Localization of messages]({% slug localization_button %})
* [Right-to-left support]({% slug rtl_button %})

For more information on using localization, internationalization, and right-to-left languages with Kendo UI widgets, refer to the article on [globalization support by Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_kendoui_globalization %}).
