# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the ButtonGroup is always available.

To change the focused Button in the ButtonGroup, use the `Left Arrow` or `Right Arrow` keys. Another option to switch between the Buttons in the ButtonGroup is to use `Tab` or `Shift` and `Tab`.

For a complete example, refer to the [demo on keyboard navigation of the ButtonGroup](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/buttongroup/keyboard-navigation).
