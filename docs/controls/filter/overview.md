# {{ site.product }} Filter Overview

The [Kendo UI Filter component](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/filter/index) a unified control for filtering data-bound components that have a [data source](/api/javascript/data/datasource).

The user interface of the Filter is useful for data-bound components that do not have a built-in UI for filtering but are required to provide filter options&mdash;for example, the ListView, Chart, and Scheduler. You can add or remove the fields by which the data will be filtered and select the global logic of the filters (`AND` or `OR`) and the filter operator for each field (for example, `contains` or `equals`). You can apply the filtering through a built-in button or through an API call. You can also select the name by which the fields will be displayed to the user and [localize]({% slug localization_kendoui_filter_widget %}) the filter operators and messages.
