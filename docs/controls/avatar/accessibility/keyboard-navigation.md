# Keyboard Navigation

The Avatar component can automatically populate the `alt` attribute of the `<img>` element and provide a text description of the Avatar's image. To use this [`alt`](/api/javascript/ui/avatar/configuration/alt) option, set the [`type`](/api/javascript/ui/avatar/configuration/type) to `image`

The Avatar is a non-focusable element.
