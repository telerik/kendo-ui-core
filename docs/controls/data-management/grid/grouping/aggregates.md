# Aggregates

The Grid enables you to display aggregated number results when the user groups its data.

To enable grouping by using aggregate functions, use the `aggregates`, `groupFooterTemplate`, `groupHeaderColumnTemplate`, or `footerTemplate` settings of the Grid and the `group` and `aggregate` fields of its data source. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using aggregate functions in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/aggregates).
