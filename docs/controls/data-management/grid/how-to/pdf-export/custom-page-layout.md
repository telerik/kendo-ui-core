# Customize Page Layout

> **Important**
> * This example used to demonstrate how to scale the Grid and add a header and footer using Drawing API shapes.
> * It is now an obsoleted built-in functionality. Refer to the article on [PDF export of a page template]({% slug exporting_pdf_kendoui_grid_widget %}#page-template).
> * The built-in method also guarantees that your getting a uniform scale factor across all pages, which is something that the previous example did not provide.
