# Inline Editing

The Grid provides options for editing its data inline when the user clicks a row.

To enable inline editing operations, set the `editable` option of the Grid to `inline`. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on setting the inline edit mode of the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/editing-inline).
