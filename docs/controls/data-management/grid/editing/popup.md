# Popup Editing

The Grid provides options for editing its data in a popup.

To enable popup editing operations, set the `editable` option of the Grid to `popup`. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on setting the popup edit mode of the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/editing-popup).
