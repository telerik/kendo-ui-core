# Batch Editing

The Grid enables you to make and save batch updates.

To enable batch editing operations in the Grid, set the `batch` option of the data source to `true`. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on setting the batch edit mode of the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/editing).
