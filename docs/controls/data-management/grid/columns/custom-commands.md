# Custom Column Commands

You can implement custom commands for handling the records of the Grid.

To include a command column which will render a button for triggering the command in the column cells:

1. Specify the text for the button through the column definition.
1. Wire the `click` event of the button to a JavaScript function which will receive the corresponding Grid data item as an argument.
1. In the function definition, handle the command.

For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on implementing custom commands in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/custom-command).
