# Reordering of Columns

The Grid provides options for reordering its columns.

To enable the user to reorder the columns of the Grid by dragging, set the `reorderable` attribute to `true`. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on implementing column reordering in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/column-reordering).
