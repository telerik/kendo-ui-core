# Data Binding Overview

By default, the Kendo UI Grid for jQuery automatically binds to data.

Immediately after the Grid loads, the [DataSource]({% slug overview_kendoui_datasourcecomponent %}) sends a query and the data is loaded to the widget. To disable this behavior, set the `autoBind` option of the widget to `false`, as shown below.

    $("#grid").kendoGrid({
        autoBind: false,
        // Other configuration.
    });

For more information about binding the Grid to data, refer to the articles on:
