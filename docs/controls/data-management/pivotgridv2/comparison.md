## Why Do Two PivotGrid Widgets Exist?

There are many developers who use and depend on the PivotGrid. Making any drastic changes to the source code of the old widget would undoubtedly interfere with their work. That is why the decision to introduce a second widget, was taken.

Ð¢he old and new versions of the PivotGrid can coexist. The old PivotGrid will not disappear with the upcoming release. This allows developers to smoothly transition to the new version without rushing their projects.

## What Can I Expect from the New PivotGridV2?

The new PivotGridV2 has improved performance, brand new design and is easier to customize.

### New Engine

The engine for the new PivotGridV2 is a cross-team development effort, meaning that it will be used by multiple different Kendo suites such as JQuery, Angular, React, and so on. This approach will ultimately lead to the implementation of many new features as all of them will be shared between the different products.

### Performance

Performance is another important aspect that is improved in the new PivotGridV2. Merging newly requested data on top of the already present data in the widget, will be much faster.

### Design

The new PivotGridV2 has a brand new design and some additional basic UX functionalities such as hiding the [`configurator`]({% slug overview_kendoui_pivotconfiguratorv2 %}) when it is not in use. This approach will provide the end user with much better experience when working with the widget.

### Customization

The new PivotGridV2 will be easier to customize when it comes down to functionalities such as data aggregation.
