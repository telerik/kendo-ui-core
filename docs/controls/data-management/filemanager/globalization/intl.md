# Internationalization

The internationalization process applies specific culture formats to a web application by providing options for the parsing and formatting of dates and numbers.

For more information, refer to:
* [Date formatting]({% slug dateformatting_kendoui_globalization %})
* [Date parsing]({% slug dateparsing_kendoui_globalization %})
* [Number formatting]({% slug numberformatting_kendoui_globalization %})
* [Number parsing]({% slug numberparsing_kendoui_globalization %})

Because the FileManager internally uses the Kendo UI Grid, you can refer to its [Internationalization documentation article]({% slug intl_kendoui_grid_widget %}) for detail information.
