# Localization

Besides the inbuilt localization options available in the [Client API section](/api/javascript/ui/filemanager/configuration/messages), the FileManager provides options for localizing its user interface by utilizing the available configuration options of its composite components. Refer to the [Grid Localization]({% slug localization_kendoui_grid_widget %}) documentation article.
