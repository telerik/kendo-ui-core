# Navigation Overview

The navigation within the file structure in the FileManager is achieved with the help of an inbuilt [TreeView](#treeview) and [Breacrumb](#breadcrumb) components.

## TreeView
On the left-hand side of the FileManager there is a nested [Kendo UI TreeView]({% slug overview_kendoui_treeview_widget %}) component, listing all folders loaded in the FileManager. The TreeView allows dragging and dropping files inside it, or between the Grid and ListView. It also provides you the possibility to rename files or folders, as well as execute commands with the inbuilt ContextMenu. 

The nested [Kendo UI TreeView]({% slug overview_kendoui_treeview_widget %}) component is the standard component from the Kendo UI suite. This is why, all functionalities and features, such as Keyboard Support and Accessibility compliance, are inherited.

## Breadcrumb

As for R1 2020, the [Breadcrumb]({% slug overview_kendoui_breadcrumb_widget %}) component is added to the Kendo UI suite and it is incorporated in the FileManager.
