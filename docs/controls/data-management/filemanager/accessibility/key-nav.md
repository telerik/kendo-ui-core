# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the FileManager is always available.

The FileManager entirely relies on the composite components for their keyboard navigation capabilities ([Grid]({% slug keynav_kendoui_grid_widget %}), TreeView, ToolBar, Breadcrumb).
The F2 button allows you to enter in edit mode of the currently selected file or folder, in order to rename it.
