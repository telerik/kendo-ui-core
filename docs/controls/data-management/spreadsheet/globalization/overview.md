# Spreadsheet Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Spreadsheet is enabled through the [localization of its messages]({% slug localization_kendoui_grid_widget %}).

For more information on using localization, internationalization, and right-to-left languages with Kendo UI widgets, refer to the article on [globalization support by Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_kendoui_globalization %}).
