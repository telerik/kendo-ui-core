# Server-Side Processing

The native data format for the Spreadsheet widget is [JSON]({% slug loadand_saveas_json_spreadsheet_widget %}). There is also the built-in support for [exporting to Excel]({% slug export_toexcel_spreadsheet_widget %}) that runs in the browser.

To export huge datasets to Excel, a well-suited solution is the new [RadSpreadStreamProcessing library](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadstreamprocessing/overview) which is part of [Telerik Document Processing (TDP) by Progress](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/introduction).  

For examples on how to export Excel files, refer to the [RadSpreadProcessing library](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadprocessing/overview).
