# PDF Export

As of the 2015 Q1 release, the PivotGrid provides a built-in PDF export functionality.

By default, PDF export is enabled when `kendo.all.min.js`, `kendo.web.min.js`, or a custom build that includes PDF scripts is loaded to the page.

To initiate PDF export by using code, use the [`pdf` configuration option](/api/javascript/ui/pivotgrid/configuration/pdf). For the runnable project, refer to the demo on [exporting the PivotGrid to PDF](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-core/pivotgrid/pdf-export).

To customize the appearance of the exported PDF file, refer to the articles on the [PDF output by the Kendo UI Drawing library]({% slug customizingappearance_drawing %}).
