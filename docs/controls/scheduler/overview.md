# {{ site.product }} Scheduler Overview

The Scheduler displays a set of events, appointments, or tasks.

It supports the display of scheduled events in different views&mdash;single days, whole weeks, or months, or as a list of tasks which need to be accomplished.

As of the R1 2017 release, exceptions are no longer automatically removed when the user edits a series. Changes that are made to specific occurrences are persisted during series editing. If a series contains an exception, the Scheduler renders a **Reset Series** button within the **Edit** dialog of the series which allows the user to reset the series by removing existing exceptions.

As of the Kendo UI 2016 Q2 (2016.2.504) release:
* The Scheduler substitutes the semicolon (`;`) as the delimiter type for recurrence exception with the comma (`,`).
* The Scheduler no longer adds a trailing delimiter to a recurrence exception.

The change was driven by the [RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#page-120) specification. Note that the previously demonstrated behavior had been incorrect.
