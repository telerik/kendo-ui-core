# Drag-and-Drop Overview

Kendo UI for jQuery provides options to handle drag-and-drop scenarios by combining the `kendoDraggable` and `kendoDropTarget` controls.  

`kendoDraggable` enables the Draggable functionality and allows a DOM element to be moved by using the mouse or a finger on touch devices.

`kendoDropTarget` creates the droppable zones and marks a DOM element as a drop target for the Draggable. The `DropTargetArea` enables you to create multiple `DropTarget` elements that are located in the area container which is a useful scenario when the `DropTarget` elements are added dynamically.
