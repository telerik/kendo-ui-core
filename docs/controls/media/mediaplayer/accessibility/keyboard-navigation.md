# Keyboard Navigation

The keyboard navigation of the MediaPlayer is always available.

To enable it, use the [`navigatable`](/api/javascript/ui/mediaplayer/configuration/navigatable) property. For a complete example, refer to the [demo on using the keyboard navigation of the MediaPlayer](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/mediaplayer/keyboard-navigation).

The MediaPlayer supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

|Shortcut |Description
|:---     |:---
|`Enter`  |Opens the video in the full-screen mode.
|`Esc`    |Exits the full-screen mode.
|`Space`  |Toggles the play and pause state.
|`M`      |Toggles the mute and unmute state.
