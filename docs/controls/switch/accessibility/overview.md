The Switch is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})




Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery Switch provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Switch is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-switch` | `role=switch` | Announces the switch role of the element. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input requires an accessible name that will be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-checked` | Announces the checked state of the Switch. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | The element must be focusable. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the Switch is in a form and announces the valid state of the component. |
| `.k-switch.k-disabled` | `aria-disabled=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the Switch is disabled. |
