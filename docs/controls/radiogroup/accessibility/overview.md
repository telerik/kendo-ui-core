Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery RadioGroup provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The RadioGroup is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-radio-list` | `role=radiogroup` | Announces the `radiogroup` role of the element. |
| `.k-radio-item` | `role=none` | Due to issues with nested items, forces a no-role state. |
| `.k-radio` | `readonly` or `aria-readonly` | The attribute is rendered only when the radio button is read-only. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the radio button is in a `form` HTML element and announces the invalid state of the component. |
| `.k-disabled > .k-radio` | `disabled` or `aria-disabled` | The attribute is rendered only when the radio button is disabled. |
