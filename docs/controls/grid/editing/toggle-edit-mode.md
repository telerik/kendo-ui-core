# Toggling Read-Only Mode

As of the R3 2024 release, the Grid allows you to enable read-only mode and disable its editing capabilities programmatically. You can reverse this and turn off read-only mode to allow editing when specific conditions are met.

* To disable editing operations, invoke the [`disableEditing()`](/api/javascript/ui/grid/methods/disableediting) method.
* To enable editing operations, call the [`enableEditing()`](/api/javascript/ui/grid/methods/enableediting) method.

For a runnable example, refer to the [Grid Toggle Edit Mode demo](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/toggle-edit-mode).
