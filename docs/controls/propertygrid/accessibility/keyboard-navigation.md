# Keyboard Navigation

The PropertyGrid gets its keyboard navigation functionality through the `navigatable` option. When set to `true`, you can initially select a row or cell and then move within the PropertyGrid by using the `Arrow` keys.

The Kendo UI for jQuery PropertyGrid supports the following keyboard shortcuts applied to the PropertyGrid Data Table:

| SHORTCUT						| DESCRIPTION				                                                        |
|:---                           |:---                                                                                |
| `Arrow keys`                  | Navigate over the cells|
| `Space`                       | Selects the row holding the currently highlighted cell|
| `Enter` or `F2`               | Puts the item in the edit mode|
| `Esc`                         | Cancels the edit or, if an element inside a cell is focused, returns the focus to the table|
| `Ctrl`+`Home`                 | Focuses the first focusable element inside the body|
| `Ctrl`+`End`                  | Focuses the last focusable element inside the body|
| `Home`                        | Focuses the first focusable cell in the row|
| `End`                         | Focuses the last focusable cell in the row|
