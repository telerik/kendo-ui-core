# Component Types

As of R2 2020 version of the Kendo UI suite, the Calendar component introduces a new component type. It aims to enhance the existing rendering and deliver a fresh and modern look and feel.

By default, the Calendar is initialized with the `classic` render mode. In order to set it to `modern`, configure the options of the component as follows:

```
    $("#calendar").kendoCalendar({
        componentType: "modern"
    });
```

As a result, the appearance of the component is changed.
