# Chart Accessibility

The Chart is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

For more information, refer to:
* [Keyboard navigation by the Kendo UI Charts]({% slug keynav_kendoui_charts_widget %})
* [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %})

## WAI-ARIA

The component follows the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for implementing the keyboard navigation for its component role and is tested against the popular screen readers. For more information, refer to the article on [WAI-ARIA support in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug wai_aria_accessibility_support %}).

## Section 508

The Chart is compliant with the Section 508 requirements. For more information, refer to the article on [Section 508 support in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug section508_accessibility_support %}).

## WCAG 2.2

The Chart supports the standards for providing accessible web content which are set by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/).

Meeting some of the Success Criteria in WCAG 2.2 may require additional customization:
* ***1.4.3** Contrast (Minimum)*

  The color of chart elements may need to be customized to meet the minimum required contrast level. Some [Theme Swatches]({% slug sassbasedthemes_swatches_kendoui %}) like the [Ocean Blue A11y Accessibility Swatch]({% slug high_contrast_theme_accessibility_support %}) meet and exceed this criteria.
* ***2.5.8:** Target Size (Minimum)*

  The size of [Series Markers](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/dataviz/ui/chart/configuration/series.markers) and the font size of [Legend Items](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/dataviz/ui/chart/configuration/legend.item) may need to be customized to meet the minimum size of 24x24px required by this criteria.
