# Keyboard Navigation

The Chart comes with keyboard navigation enabled out of the box. The main interactive parts of the Chart are reachable through the keyboard - the Chart area and Legend area.

For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using the keyboard navigation of the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/charts/keyboard-navigation).

## Basic Concepts

Once the element receives focus, there will be two main focusable areas the user can be in - the main chart area and the legend (if one is present). Moving focus between the chart area and legend area is done with the `Tab` and `Shift` & `Tab` keys. Once focus is in one of the two areas, the user can navigate through the items using the arrow keys.

> The only focusable element of the Chart is the main wrapper element itself. Focusing individual points or legend items is implemented through the `aria-activedescendant` attribute. This works in the same way for both `SVG` and `Canvas` render modes.

## Available Shortcuts

When the chart area is focused, the following keyboard commands are available:

| SHORTCUT              | DESCRIPTION
|:---                   |:---
| `Right Arrow`         | Moves focus to the next point in the series. If focus is on the last point of the series, moves focus to the first point of the next series.
| `Left Arrow`          | Moves focus to the previous point in the series. If focus is on the first point of the series, moves focus to the last point of the previous series.
| `Down Arrow`          | Moves focus to the next series.
| `Up Arrow`            | Moves focus to the previous series.
| `Tab`                 | Moves the focus to the legend area. If the legend is not visible, or if legend position is `top` or `left`, moves focus to the next focusable element on the page.
| `Shift` & `Tab`       | Moves the focus to the previous focusable element on the page. If legend position is `top` or `left`, moves focus to the legend area.

When the legend area is focused, the following keyboard commands are available:

| SHORTCUT              | DESCRIPTION
|:---                   |:---
| `Right Arrow`         | Moves focus to the next legend item. If we're already at the last item, focus cycles to the first item.
| `Left Arrow`          | Moves focus to the previous legend item. If we're already at the first item, focus cycles to the last item.
| `Down Arrow`          | Moves focus to the next legend item. If we're already at the last item, focus cycles to the first item.
| `Up Arrow`            | Moves focus to the previous legend item. If we're already at the first item, focus cycles to the last item.
| `Tab`                 | Moves the focus to the next focusable element on the page. If the legend position is `top` or `left`, moves focus to the chart area.
| `Shift` & `Tab`       | Moves the focus to the chart area. If the legend position is `top` or `left`, moves focus to the previous focusable element on the page.
