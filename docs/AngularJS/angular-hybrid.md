# AngularJS for Hybrid UI

As of the Kendo UI Q3 2014 release, the suite includes AngularJS directives for some of its Hybrid UI components such as the hybrid mobile Application and View, the SplitView, and the ModalView.

In this context, the mobile views support AngularJS controllers, directives and two-way data binding expressions.

## Getting Started

The following example demonstrates how to use the Hybrid UI Application directive. By default, the `kendo-mobile-application` directive is set to the `body` element with `ng-app`.

###### Example

    <body kendo-mobile-application ng-app="foo">
        <kendo-mobile-view ng-controller="MyCtrl" k-title="'My Title'" k-layout="'default'">
            <kendo-mobile-header>
                <kendo-mobile-nav-bar>
                    <kendo-view-title></kendo-view-title>
                </kendo-mobile-nav-bar>
            </kendo-mobile-header>

            {% raw %} {{hello}} {% endraw %}
        </kendo-mobile-view>

        <script>
            angular.module("foo", [ "kendo.directives" ])
                .controller("MyCtrl", function($scope) {
                    $scope.hello = "Hello World!";
                });
        </script>
    </body>

## Routing

The mobile application instantiates and maintains its own routing mechanism based on the [`router`]({% slug router_kendoui_singlepageapplication %}) component which automatically matches and instantiates views when navigating.

Note that unlike the [`ng-route`, `ng-view`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute), and the [`ui-router`](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) implementations, the mobile application does not unload the previous view when navigating to the new one. Also, AngularJS routing mechanisms are not supported.

## Controllers

If an `ng-controller` directive is set to the `view` element, the controller definition is executed each time the view is shown, matching the view `show`
event.

## Hybrid UI Widget Directives

All directives may be used as elements or as attributes. If a directive is used as an element name, it is replaced with a standard HTML element once the directive is compiled. Each mobile widget features AngularJS on the [Kendo UI demos web site](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/).

### ActionSheet

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-action-sheet` directive. The item actions are assigned with the `k-action` attribute and are resolved from the widget scope.

### Button

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-button` directive.

### BackButton

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-back-button` directive.

### DetailButton

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-detail-button` directive.

### ButtonGroup

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-button-group` directive.

### Collapsible

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-collapsible` directive. The inner markup follows the same convention as the non-Angular widget.

### Drawer

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-drawer` directive. Like the view, it calls the controller (if present) each time it is displayed.

### MobileListView

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-list-view` directive.

### ModalView

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-modal-view` directive. Like the view, it calls the controller (if present) each time it is displayed.

### NavBar

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-nav-bar` directive. The element displaying the view title is instantiated from the `kendo-view-title` directive.

### PopOver

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-pop-over` directive. The `ng-controller` directives may be set to the popover views.

### Scroller

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-scroller` directive.

### ScrollView

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-scroll-view` directive.

### Switch

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-switch` directive. The directive should be used as an attribute of an `input` element if the value should be submitted with a form.

### TabStrip

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-tab-strip` directive.

### Application

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-application` directive.

### Touch

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-touch` directive.

### View

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-view` directive. The header and footer elements may be instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-header` and `kendo-mobile-footer` directives, respectively.

### SplitView

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-split-view` directive. The panes are instantiated with the `kendo-mobile-pane` directive.

### Layout

The widget is instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-layout` directive. The header and footer elements may be instantiated from the `kendo-mobile-header` and `kendo-mobile-footer` directives, respectively.

## Widget Directives Attributes

The hybrid mobile widgets may be configured via the `k-` prefixed attributes. For more information on the parsing of attributes, refer to the [introductory article on AngularJS]({% slug angularjs_integration_directives %}).
