# Drawing API Overview

The [Kendo UI Drawing API](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/drawing/index) is a cross-browser vector graphics library. It offers a simple object model for building and manipulating visual scenes.

## Basic Usage

### Components

You build a scene by creating drawing elements such as curves, images, and text. Scene elements are live and respond to changes of their appearance and geometry.

A drawing surface is used to render scenes on and off screen. Surfaces encapsulate specific browser technologies such as SVG or Canvas.

### Design Goals

The Kendo UI Drawing API is designed to serve as a foundation of and extension point for the Kendo UI widgets rendering data visualization, such as Charts and Diagrams.

The Drawing API is also a stand-alone component suitable for building custom visualizations.
