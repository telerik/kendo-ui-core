# ObservableObject

The [`kendo.data.ObservableObject`](/api/javascript/data/observableobject) is an important part of the Kendo UI MVVM framework, specifically of the View-Model. It supports change tracking and notifies any subscribers when a change occurs. All View-Model objects inherit from `kendo.data.ObservableObject`.

Note that from now on ObservableObject and View-Model are going to be used interchangeably.

## Getting Started

### Initialize the ObservableObject

To initialize an `ObservableObject`, create a new instance of the `kendo.data.ObservableObject` type or use the `kendo.observable` method, as demonstrated in the example below. The end result is the same.

###### Example

    var viewModel1 = new kendo.data.ObservableObject( {
      field1: "value1",
      field2: "value2"
    });

    var viewModel2 = kendo.observable( {
      field1: "value1",
      field2: "value2"
    });


The `kendo.bind` method converts internally the provided View-Model object to an `ObservableObject` unless that object is already an `ObservableObject`.

### Important Notes on Getting Started

#### When to Use Each Method for Initializing a View-Model

If the View-Model object is going to be used after initialization (before or after calling `kendo.bind`), the `kendo.observable` method or the `new kendo.data.ObservableObject` must be used, as shown in the example below.

###### Example

    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
    name: "John Doe"
    });

    viewModel.set("name", "Jane Doe"); // use the View-Model object after initialization


If the View-Model object is not going to be used after declaration, you can define it as a regular JavaScript object. The `kendo.bind` method will not convert the original View-Model object to `kendo.data.ObservableObject`. That is why the code, demonstrated in the example below, is not going to work. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to always use the `kendo.observable` to initialize the View-Model object.

###### Example

    var viewModel = {
       name: "John Doe"
    };

    kendo.bind(document.body, viewModel);

    /*
    The following statement  will fail because the View-Model
    is not an instance of kendo.data.ObservableObject.
    */
    viewModel.set("name", "Jane Doe");

## Field Values

### Get Field Values

#### Get the Value of an ObservableObject Field

Use the `get` method to get the value of an `ObservableObject` field, as demonstrated in the example below.

###### Example

    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
     name: "John Doe"
    });

    var name = viewModel.get("name");
    alert(name); // shows "John Doe"

#### Get the Nested Field Value

Getting a nested field value is also supported, as shown in the example below.

###### Example

    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
     person: {
         name: "John Doe"
     }
    });
    var personName = viewModel.get("person.name");
    alert(personName); // shows "John Doe"

### Set Field Values

#### Set the Value of an ObservableObject Field

Use the `set` method to set the value of an `ObservableObject` field, as demonstrated in the example below.

###### Example

    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
        name: "John Doe"
    });

    viewModel.set("name", "Jane Doe"); //set the "name" field to "Jane Doe"

    var name = viewModel.get("name");
    alert(name); // shows "Jane Doe"

#### Set the Nested Field Value

Setting a nested field value is also supported, as shown in the example below.

###### Example

    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
     person: {
         name: "John Doe"
     }
    });

    viewModel.set("person.name", "Jane Doe");

    var personName = viewModel.get("person.name");
    alert(personName); // shows "Jane Doe"

## Dependent Methods

### Create Dependent Methods

Often there is need to convert a View-Model field value to a format more suitable for display in the View. In such cases, extending the View-Model with a dependent method is essential.

The example below demonstrates how to create dependent methods, also known as calculated fields.

###### Example

    <span data-bind="text: fullName"></span>
    <script>
    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        fullName: function() {
            return this.get("firstName") + " " + this.get("lastName");
        }
    });

    kendo.bind($("span"), viewModel);
    </script>

In the example, `fullName` is a dependent method because it depends on `firstName` and `lastName`. Changing the value of either `firstName` or `lastName` via the `set` method would also change `fullName`. As a result, all bindings referring to `fullName` are going to be updated.

### Set Values of Dependent Properties

The example below demonstrates how to set values of dependent properties.

###### Example

    <p>Full Name: <input data-bind="value: fullName"></p>
    <p>First Name: <span data-bind="text: firstName"></span></p>
    <p>Last Name: <span data-bind="text: lastName"></span></p>

    <script>
      var vm = kendo.observable({
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        fullName: function(value) {
          if (value !== undefined) {
            var name = value.split(" ");

            this.set("firstName", name[0]);
            this.set("lastName", name[1]);
          } else {
            return this.get("firstName") + " " + this.get("lastName");
          }
        }
      });

      kendo.bind(document.body, vm);
    </script>

### Important Notes on Dependent Methods

#### Nested Calculated Field Setters

Currently, the Kendo UI MVVM does not support the setting of values of dependent properties when the calculated field is nested. In other words, the above example, where the setting of `fullName` will lead to the setting of `firstName` and `lastName`, will only work if `fullName` is defined as a root field of the `viewModel`.

#### Dependent Methods to Use the get Method for Getting Field Values

If the `get` method is not used, the Kendo UI MVVM fails to detect any dependencies of the dependent method. As a result, changing any of the dependencies would not be reflected properly.

###### Example

    var viewModel = kendo.observable({
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        fullName: function() {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; // this implementation is incorrect, as it does not use get()
        }
    });

This implementation of the `fullName` uses direct field access instead of the `get` method. As a result, the dependencies of `fullName` are not tracked. Changing the value of either `firstName` or `lastName` via the `set` method would not cause the change of `fullName`. This means that no binding referring to `fullName` is going to be updated.

Avoid using direct field access when implementing dependent methods. Always use the `get` method to obtain the field values.
