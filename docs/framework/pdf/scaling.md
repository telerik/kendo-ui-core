# Scaling the Drawings

The Drawing library enables you to export a PDF document that is bigger or smaller than its original elements.

The scaling feature is convenient when you generate a multi-page PDF output by using the automatic page-breaking feature. Because the original dimensions usually look too big in PDF, you can specify a suitable scale factor to get a better output for print. To scale the content when you export files to PDF, use the `scale` option from the Drawing library. While the `scale` setting affects the content, the output paper size and page margins remain the same. However, scaling affects the position of the headers and footers of page templates.

    kendo.drawing.drawDOM("#content", {
      paperSize: "A4",
      margin: "2cm",
      scale: 0.8
    }).then(function(group){
      kendo.drawing.pdf.saveAs(group, "filename.pdf");
    });

If you need different horizontal or vertical scale factors, pass either an array&mdash;`[ xScale, yScale ]`&mdash;or an object&mdash;`{ x: xScale, y: yScale }`.
