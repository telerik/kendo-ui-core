#Date Formatting

The purpose of date formatting is to convert Date object to a human readable string using culture's specific settings. [kendo.format](/api/javascript/kendo#format) and [kendo.toString](/api/javascript/kendo#tostring) methods support standard and custom date formats:

## Standard date formats

- *d* - short date pattern ("M/d/yyyy" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "d")` -> 10/6/2000

- "D" - long date pattern (dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "D")` -> Monday, November 06, 2000

- *F* - Full date/time pattern ("dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy h:mm:ss tt" for en-US)

    kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "F") -> Monday, November 06, 2000 12:00:00 AM

- *g* - General date/time pattern (short time) ("M/d/yyyy h:mm tt" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "g")` -> 11/6/2000 12:00 AM

- *G* - General date/time pattern (long time) ("M/d/yyyy h:mm:ss tt" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "G")` -> 11/6/2000 12:00:00 AM

- *M/m* - Month/day pattern ("MMMM dd" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "m")` -> November 06

- *u* - Universal sortable date/time pattern ("yyyy'-'MM'-'dd HH':'mm':'ss'Z'" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "u")` -> 2000-11-06 00:00:00Z

- *Y/y* - Year/month pattern ("MMMM, yyyy" for en-US)

    `kendo.toString(new Date(2000, 10, 6), "y")` -> November, 2000
