# Webpack

The Kendo UI packaged scripts are in an AMD-compatible format, which means that they can be used by [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io). This article illustrates the necessary Webpack configuration for this setup.

## Obtain Packaged Kendo UI Script Files

This section is intended for holders of the commercial Kendo UI Complete license.

The commercial Kendo UI distribution `zip` file, available for download for the active customer subscriptions has the packaged scripts available in the `js` directory.

However, Webpack will generally work better with source JavaScript files than it will with distribution-ready files that have already been minified and uglified.  Webpack can minify and uglify your final build files for you via its UglifyJsPlugin (example included below).  For this reason, you should point Webpack to use the files in the /src folder whenever that is available to you.

## Build AMD-Formatted Scripts

This section is intended for users of the Kendo UI Core open-source distribution.

The instructions for obtaining and building the Kendo UI Core scripts are listed in the [README](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core#how-to-build-kendo-ui-core).

Once the scripts are available and present in your project directory, the Webpack configuration demonstrated in the sections below will pick and bundle them in your project.

### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Kendo UI with webpack</title>
  <!-- the styles may also be loaded with webpack -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2016.1.112/styles/kendo.common.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2016.1.112/styles/kendo.default.min.css">

  <script src="bundle.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <input id="ddl" />
</body>
</html>
```

### main.js

```javascript
require('jquery')

require('kendo.dropdownlist')

$("#dropdownlist").kendoDropDownList({
    dataTextField: "text",
    dataValueField: "value",
    dataSource: [
      { text: "Item1", value: "1" },
      { text: "Item2", value: "2" }
    ]
});
```

### webpack.config.js

```javascript
var path = require('path');
module.exports = {
    resolve: {
        extensions: [ '', '.js', 'min.js' ],
        root: [
            path.resolve('.'),
            path.resolve('../kendo/src/js/') // the path to the source scripts (preferable to dist scripts)
        ]
    },
    entry: './main',
    output: {
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
     plugins: [
     // To have Webpack minify/uglify the file(s) that it builds.  Note: this will slow down
     // the build process, so use for final build only, and not for development version when
     // using webpack-dev-server.
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
          compress: {
              warnings: false
          }
      })
  ]
}
```

You may test the configuration above by running the `webpack-dev-server` executable in the directory.
