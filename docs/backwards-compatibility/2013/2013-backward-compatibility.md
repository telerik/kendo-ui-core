# Kendo UI 2013 Breaking Changes

## Kendo UI 2013 Q3

### Changes from 2013 Q2 SP1 (2013.2.918)

#### Breaking Changes

* **Core**: kendo.support.pointers now only shows support for IE11 pointer events - kendo.support.msPointers was added to indicate that IE10 pointer events are supported too.

* **Splitter**: the internal method `trigger("resize")`, which has been provided as a workaround in certain scenarios, no longer works. It has been replaced with a [public API method `resize()`]({% slug responsivewebdesign_integration_kendoui %}), which now all Kendo UI widgets have.

For more information, see also [`kendo.resize()`](/api/javascript/kendo#methods-resize).

* **Splitter**: the `layoutChange` event is now obsolete and will be removed in the future. Please use the `resize` event instead.

* **Kendo UI Scheduler for ASP.NET MVC**: "ISchedulerEvent" interface now includes two additional fields - `StartTimezone` and `EndTimezone` which stores the timezone information of the event.

* **Scheduler**: Changes in `recurrenceEditor` messages:
 -  `daily.days` becomes `daily.interval`
 -  `weekly.weeks` becomes `weekly.interval`
 -  `monthly.months` becomes `monthly.interval`
 -  `yearly.years` becomes `yearly.interval`
 -  `end.endLabel` becomes `end.label`
 -  `end.endNever` becomes `end.never`
 -  `end.endCountAfter` becomes `end.after`
 -  `end.endCountOccurrence` becomes `end.occurrence`
 -  `end.endUntilOn` becomes `end.on`

* **MVC DataSource**: The MVC DataSource transport now serializes numbers based on the used Kendo culture. As a result, if you are using an invariant culture number model binder, the numbers will not be parsed correctly. You should either use the the same culture to parse the numbers in the model binder or remove the model binder in order for numbers with a decimal separator to be parsed correctly.

* **ModalView**: The ModalView now supports auto-sizing when its content changes and when no height is set. Unfortunately we were able to implement this at the expense of
the possibility to set the ModalView size in a CSS stylesheet. As a workaround please use the ModalView width and height options or set them through inline CSS instead.

## Kendo UI 2013 Q2

### Changes from 2013 Q1 SP1 (2013.1.514)

#### Breaking Changes

* **themes**: The icons in the sprite image have been rearranged to include more icons in two different sizes.

* **Editor**: The default tool set now includes the newly introduced table editing. Toolbar tools are now grouped, so their dimensions have been increased by 2px. On the other hand,
the "Font name" and "Font size" tools no longer appear by default. The idea is to encourage developers (and users respectively) to use the formatting dropdown, which provides a predefined (and customizable) set of options.
This will ultimately lead to better structured, formatted and consistent rich text documents, compared to the case when the user has the ability to apply arbitrary font styles.

If you need the old tool set, use the configuration below:

```
        $("#editor").kendoEditor({
            tools: [
                "bold", "italic", "underline", "strikethrough",
                "fontName", "fontSize", "foreColor", "backColor",
                "justifyLeft", "justifyCenter", "justifyRight", "justifyFull",
                "insertUnorderedList", "insertOrderedList",
                "indent", "outdent",
                "formatBlock",
                "createLink", "unlink", "insertImage"
            ]
        });
```

* **Editor**: Initializing the editor from a `div` element triggers the [inline editing mode](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/editor/inline-editing.html). If you need to revert to the old behavior, initialize it from a `<textarea>` element.

* **Mobile ListView**:

Enabling endless scrolling or press to load more configuration options now puts the ListView in a virtual mode, which has different behavior than Q1 2013 and previous releases.

1. `endlessScrollParameters` and `loadMoreParameters` configuration options are not available anymore. Endless scrolling uses on the dataSource paging configuration to issue subsequent requests.

1. `scrollTreshold` option is not available anymore. The ListView automatically prefetches the next page when 2/3 of the current page is reached.

1. `stopEndlessScrolling` and `stopLoadMore` methods are no longer available. The ListView automatically hides the button and loading indicator when the items loaded reach the number returned by the `schema.total` method of the bound DataSource.

1. `lastPageReached` event is no longer triggered, due to the same reasons.

#### Deprecated Functionality

* **Editor**: The **formatBlock** and **style** tools have been deprecated in favor of the unified **formatting** tool. The new tool supports the functionality of both old tools, as well as new styling options. If you need to keep the styles and block formats in different drop-downs, you can use two formatting tools in parallel. The old tool declarations work, yielding a console.warn about the deprecation, and will be removed with a future official release.

Old rendering:

```
	$("#editor").kendoEditor({
		tools: [
			{ name: "style", items: [
				// applies class "foo"
 			{ text: "foo", value: "foo" }
		] },

			{ name: "formatBlock", items: [
				// changes wrapping block to paragraph
			{ text: "paragraph", value: "p" }
		] }
			]
		});
```

New rendering:

```
	$("#editor").kendoEditor({
		tools: [
			{ name: "formatting", items: [
				// applies class "foo"
				{ text: "foo", value: ".foo" },

				// changes wrapping block to paragraph
				{ text: "paragraph", value: "p" },

				// changes wrapping block to paragraph with class "fine-print"
				{ text: "fine print", value: "p.fine-print" }
				] }
			]
		});
```

## Kendo UI 2013 Q1

### Changes from 2012 Q3 SP1 (2012.3.1315)

#### Breaking Changes

* jQuery is updated to 1.9.1

* **Mobile:** Rename scrollTreshold option of the ListView to **scrollThreshold**

* **AutoComplete/ComboBox/DropDownList:** Rename enable option to **enabled**

* **TreeView/HierarchicalDataSource/Node:** The `children` field is initialized depending on the `hasChildren` field, as previously documented. Use the `append` and `load` methods to initialize it, and if accessing the children field directly, verify if it is present.

#### ASP.NET MVC

Some ASP.NET MVC applications may be broken if using other libraries incompatible with jQuery 1.9.1. Further details available in the [troubleshooting guide](/aspnet-mvc/troubleshoot/troubleshooting#javascript-error-that-live-method-is-unavailable,-undefined-or-unsupported)
