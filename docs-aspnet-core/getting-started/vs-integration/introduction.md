# Visual Studio Integration Overview

The Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for ASP.NET Core Visual Studio (VS) Extensions enhance the experience in developing MVC web applications with Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core.

As their major advantage, the VS extensions handle the [creation of projects]({% slug gettingstarted_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}#configuration-Create). The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core VS extensions support VS 2017 and 2019 and are distributed with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core installer.

> VS Express editions are not supported.

* To access the VS extensions, use the **Telerik | Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core** menu on the VS **Start Page**.

* To add the project template, select it from the drop-down list of options. As a result, the added project template becomes available in the language-specific nodes of the dialog as well. Under the **CSharp\Web** node, the **Add New Project** dialog contains the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core web application.
