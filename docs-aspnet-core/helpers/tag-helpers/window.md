# Window Tag Helper Overview

The Window tag helper helps you configure the Kendo UI Window widget in ASP.NET Core applications.

## Basic Usage

The following example demonstrates how to define the Window by using the Window tag helper.

###### Example

        <kendo-window name="window1">Window contents</kendo-window>

## Configuration

The Window tag helper configuration options are passed as attributes of the tag. The Window contents is placed between the opening and closing tag.

###### Example

```tab-cshtml

        @(Html.Kendo().Window()
            .Name("window")
            .Title("About Alvar Aalto")
            .Content(@<text>
                <div class="armchair">
                    <img src="@Url.Content("~/shared/web/window/armchair-402.png")"
                            alt="Artek Alvar Aalto - Armchair 402" />
                    Artek Alvar Aalto - Armchair 402
                </div>

                <p>
                    Alvar Aalto is one of the greatest names in modern architecture and design.
                    Glassblowers at the iittala factory still meticulously handcraft the legendary
                    vases that are variations on one theme, fluid organic shapes that let the end user
                    ecide the use. Interpretations of the shape in new colors and materials add to the
                    growing Alvar Aalto Collection that remains true to his original design.
                </p>
            </text>)
            .Draggable()
            .Width(600)
            .Events(ev => ev.Close("onClose"))
        )
```
```tab-tagHelper

        <kendo-window name="window" title="About Alvar Aalto" draggable="true"
            width="400" on-close="onClose">
            <div class="armchair">
                <img src="@Url.Content("~/shared/web/window/armchair-402.png")"
                    alt="Artek Alvar Aalto - Armchair 402" />
                Artek Alvar Aalto - Armchair 402
            </div>

            <p>
                Alvar Aalto is one of the greatest names in modern architecture and design.
                Glassblowers at the iittala factory still meticulously handcraft the legendary
