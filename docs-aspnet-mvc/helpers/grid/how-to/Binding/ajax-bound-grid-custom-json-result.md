# Use Custom JsonResult with Ajax-Bound Grids

This example demonstrates how to use a custom JSON serializer for the controller and for the server-bound data of the widget.

For the controller, this is achieved by overriding the `Json` method. For the widgets, this is achieved through the registration (with the ID) of a custom `IJavaScriptInitializer` implementation on the application `start` event.

To see the example, refer to the project on how to [use a custom `JsonResult` with an Ajax-bound Grid](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/ajax-bound-grid-custom-json-result).
