# Color Alternating Rows

The demo on how to color the alternating rows of an exported Grid to Excel uses the [`background`](/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ooxml/workbook#configuration-sheets.rows.cells.background) option of the cell to set the background color of the alternating rows.

To see the example, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/alternating-rows).

> **Important**
>
> This project requires UI for ASP.NET MVC version 2014.3.1125 and later. Earlier versions do not have the `ExcelExport` event exposed through the fluent API.

For more information on how Excel documents work, refer to the [introductory article on Excel](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/excel/introduction).
