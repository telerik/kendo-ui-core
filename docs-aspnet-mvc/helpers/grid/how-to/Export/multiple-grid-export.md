# Export Multiple Grids to Excel

To see the example, refer to the project on how to [export multiple Kendo UI Grids to the same Excel document](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/miltiple-grid-excel).

As a result, each Grid is exported to a separate Excel sheet.

> **Important**
>
> This project requires UI for ASP.NET MVC version 2014.3.1125 and later. Earlier versions do not have the `ExcelExport` event exposed through the fluent API.

For more information, refer to the article on how to [create Excel documents](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/excel/introduction#create-excel-document).
