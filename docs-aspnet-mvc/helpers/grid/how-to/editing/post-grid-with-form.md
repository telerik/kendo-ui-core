# Post Grid Data with Form

To submit the Grid data items as part of an `Html.Form`, you have to note the known limitations.

These are:

* All items in the Grid are submitted no matter if they are updated or not.
* Only the items from the current page are submitted.
* Server operations must be disabled&mdash;`ServerOperation(false)`.

To see the example, refer to the project on how to [submit the Grid data items as part of an `Html.Form`](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/grid/post-grid-with-form).
