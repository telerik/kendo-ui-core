# Create the Single-Page App

**Figure 1. An overview of the Kendo UI Music Store Sales page**

The Music Store Dashboard is constructed as a single-page app (SPA) that is built to deliver smooth transitions and high performance. Using the `Sammy.js` framework, the various pages of the application are routed through it and in ASP.NET MVC.

## Getting Started

### Initialize App in MVC

Start with the basic ASP.NET MVC `HomeController.cs`.

###### Example

		public class HomeController : Controller
		{
			public ActionResult Index()
			{
				return View();
			}
		}

`Index.cshtml` is reduced to a very skeletal structure.

###### Example

	@{
			Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
		}
	  <div id="container">
		<div id="main"></div>
	</div>

<!--_-->
Each page of the app requires the three components listed below:

* HTML page
* CSS stylesheet
* JavaScript file

Additionally, a site-wide `Site.css`, `app.js`, and `main-view.js` are required. MVC provides the framework for the single page, but the plumbing must be included.

A large amount of the structure is therefore included in `_Layout.cshtml`. Note that the portions are omitted for brevity.

###### Example

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	  	<link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/Site.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  		<link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/home-view.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    	<link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/music-view.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    	<link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/social-view.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
	</head>

	<body>
		@RenderBody()

        <script src="@Url.Content("~/js/libs/jquery-2.0.0.min.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="@Url.Content("~/js/libs/kendo.all.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="@Url.Content("~/js/debug/app.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>

References to various Kendo CSS&mdash;in `<head>`&mdash;are also required.

###### Example

  	<link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/themes/base/kendo.common.min.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/themes/base/kendo.dataviz.min.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/themes/kendo.moonlight.min.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/themes/kendo.dataviz.moonlight.min.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

### Set Up SPA Plumbing

The Music Store Dashboard application is a simple JavaScript object named `musicDashboard`. It is defined in an anonymous function and added to the Window object.

###### Example

  (function (window, undefined) {

      var musicDashboard = {

          // The Guts Go Here

      };

      return (window.musicDashboard = musicDashboard);

  }(window));

The `musicDashboard` object has a setup method that initializes the router member to a new Kendo UI Router object. The Router object allows you to define the URLs of your application. This means they can be shared to provide a deep linking to your application.

For more information on the [Kendo UI Router object](http://blogs.telerik.com/kendoui/posts/13-05-09/a-day-at-the-spa-with-kendo.router "Kendo Router"), refer to http://blogs.telerik.com/kendoui/posts/13-05-09/a-day-at-the-spa-with-kendo.router.

###### Example

  //kendoui router object
  router: undefined,

  setup: function () {

      this.router = new kendo.Router();

      //setup views
      this.setupRoutes();

      this.router.start();

  },

Each route must be defined and the Music Dashboard does this in a method called `setupRoutes`. Once the routes have been defined, the router is started by calling the `start()` method.

Each route is defined by a URL and a callback method. The URL is the route or value defined after the `#` (hash). SPAs rely on an old technique of using a `#` in a URL to define a unique URL. When the `#` value changes in a URL, the browser does not send the request to the server. Instead it looks for the target on the page and also fires a `hashchange` event. The Kendo UI Router object is wired to the `hashchange` event and executes the route's corresponding callback when the event fires.

The example below demonstrates a truncated callback method and routes defined for each view in the Music Dashboard application.

###### Example

   //defined Routes for Kendo UI
   setupRoutes: function () {

      var that = this;

      if (that.router) {

          that.router.route("/", function () {});

          that.router.route("/sales", function () {});

          that.router.route("/social", function () {});

      }

    },

The dashboard's route callbacks follow a common pattern. Destroy any existing views, make sure the top navigation has CSS classes applied correctly, and create the target view.

For more information on how to manage views, refer to the [next section of this article]({% slug createthespa_muscistoredashboard_aspnetmvc %}#manage-views).

###### Example

    that.router.route("/", function () {

        console.log("home");

        //destroy other views or they will be markup artifacts on the screen
        that.salesView.destroy();
        that.socialView.destroy();

        $(".main-nav-item-selected").removeClass("main-nav-item-selected");
        $(".main-nav-item-icon-selected").removeClass("main-nav-item-icon-selected");
        $(".nav-music-icon").addClass("main-nav-item-icon-selected");
        $(".nav-music").addClass("main-nav-item-selected");

        that.createMainView();

    });

## Configuration

### Manage Views

The `musicDashboard` setup method of the object calls another method, `setupViews`, to initialize the Kendo UI views.

###### Example

    setup: function () {

        this.router = new kendo.Router();

        this.setupViews();
        this.setupRoutes();            

        this.router.start();

    },

The `setupViews` method initializes each view&mdash;main, social, and sales&mdash;by selecting the elements from the page and passing their corresponding markup to the `kendo.View` constructor. There is an additional, optional model parameter that can be provided. However, it is not needed for the Music Dashboard. The Kendo UI Views are used to help manage the swapping of the main content between views as the user navigates through the application.

###### Example

    //define views for Kendo UI
    setupViews: function () {

        var that = this,
            sv = document.querySelector("#salesview"),
            socv = document.querySelector("#socialView"),
            mv = document.querySelector("#mainview");

        //outerHTML
        that.salesView = new kendo.View(sv.outerHTML);
        that.socialView = new kendo.View(socv.outerHTML);
        that.mainView = new kendo.View(mv.outerHTML);

    },

When a view is requested, its create method is called. For the Music Store Dashboard this is done in the router's callback methods. The non-active views are destroyed, which removes them from the DOM as well as clears variables used by the view. When a view is displayed, it is rendered. This is done by calling the view's `render` method and passing the selector of the view's parent element. For the Music Dashboard this is the `#main` element.

###### Example

    createMainView: function () {

        var that = this;

        that.mainView.render("#main");

        //more functionality here
    },

### Handle Page Navigation

**Figure 2. The navigation strip of the Music Store Dashboard**

![navigation-strip](/tutorials/tutorial-kendo-music-store/music-store-dashboard/images/navigation-strip.png)

The various pages of the Music Dashboard are accessed through the navigation strip at the top.

Because the Music Dashboard is a SPA, the strip must be placed in `_Layout.cshtml` so that the navigation is available on every page. Each page, other than the main one, must be placed in the `<nav>`.

###### Example

		<header id="main-header">
	        <nav class="main-nav">
	            <a href="#"><span class="main-nav-item nav-music"><span class="main-nav-item-icon nav-music-icon"></span></span></a>
	            <a href="#/sales"><span class="main-nav-item nav-sales"><span class="main-nav-item-icon nav-sales-icon"></span></span></a>
	            <a href="#/social"><span class="main-nav-item nav-social"><span class="main-nav-item-icon nav-social-icon"></span></span></a>
	        </nav>
		</header>

The `class` attributes in the `<span>` tags are defined in `Site.css`.

### Set Up Clicks and Routing

Because the routes are defined using the Kendo UI Router, there is no real need to define click or touch event handlers to drive navigation. Instead, simple `<a href="">` anchors that change the URL `#` value are defined for each menu item.
