## Compatibility and Requirements

Kendo UI Core depends on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.9.1+

Kendo UI Core has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with Kendo UI Core, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.


## Building Kendo UI Core

There are two ways to get the source code for Kendo UI Core. You can either download a pre-built zip from [Telerik.com](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/open-source-core), or build the source yourself using Grunt. The latter approach includes an option for building a distribution of Kendo UI Core that includes only the widgets and framework features required by your app.

### Installing Dependencies

In order to build Kendo UI Core, you need to have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.7 or later.

For Windows you have to download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Mac OS users should install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build them from source.

### How to build Kendo UI Core

Clone a copy of the repository by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core.git
```

Enter the repository directory

```bash
cd kendo-ui-core
```

Initialize the submodule repository

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Run the build script:
```bash
npm run build
```
The minified version of the scripts and styles of Kendo UI Core will be put in the `dist/` subdirectory.

If you want to create custom build or help with Kendo UI Core development, it would be better to install [grunt command line interface](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) as a global package:

```
[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Make sure you have `grunt` installed by testing:

```
grunt --version
```

Now by running `grunt` command in the Kendo UI Core directory, you can build full version of Kendo UI Core, just like with `npm run build` command:
```
grunt build
```

There are several other tasks available:
```
grunt -help
```

### Building only what you need

The grunt `custom` task will create a custom minified file - `dist/kendo.custom.min.js`, which includes only the specified components. The following command will include only the autocomplete and dropdownlist widgets:

```
grunt custom:autocomplete,dropdownlist
```

## Source Code and Downloads

If you want to skip building Kendo UI Core yourself, head on over to [Telerik.com](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/open-source-core) to grab the full source.

## Using Kendo UI Core via the Kendo Static CDN

You can also easily include Kendo UI Core into your site or application using the Kendo CDN:

```
<link href="http://cdn.kendostatic.com/2014.2.716/styles/kendo.common.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="http://cdn.kendostatic.com/2014.2.716/styles/kendo.default.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="http://cdn.kendostatic.com/2014.2.716/js/jquery.min.js"></script>    
<script src="http://cdn.kendostatic.com/2014.2.716/js/kendo.ui.core.min.js"></script> 
```
The main advantage to this is that your users may be able to leverage a primed cache version of Kendo UI Core if they've visited other sites using the framework.
